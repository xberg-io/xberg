//! Cores-vs-throughput benchmark for batch document concurrency.
//!
//! This is the benchmark referenced by `docs-site/src/content/docs/guides/concurrency.mdx`
//! ("Layout inference: adding cores will not help"). It sweeps `ConcurrencyConfig::max_threads`
//! against two batch cohorts and measures wall-clock throughput:
//!
//! - `non_layout_batch`: plain Markdown documents, no layout inference. Batch worker count
//!   (`resolve_batch_execution_plan`'s `workers`) follows the normal ceiling, so throughput is
//!   expected to scale up as the thread budget grows.
//! - `all_layout_pdf_batch`: every input is a PDF processed with layout-driven Markdown
//!   (`use_layout_for_markdown = true`), which `classify_layout_batch` classifies as
//!   `LayoutBatchWorkload::All`. `resolve_batch_execution_plan` then pins the batch to a single
//!   document worker (`MAX_NATIVE_LAYOUT_BATCH_WORKERS = 1`) regardless of the thread budget, so
//!   throughput is expected to stay flat across the sweep.
//!
//! The contrast between the two cohorts is the result: a single-cohort run proves nothing about
//! whether the flattening is specific to layout batches or just a property of small batches.
//!
//! # Threats to validity and how this benchmark controls for them
//!
//! 1. **Content-hash cache.** `xberg`'s extraction cache is keyed on file bytes + config, so a
//!    warm cache would make every sample after the first measure a cache lookup instead of real
//!    extraction work. Every [`ExtractionConfig`] below sets `use_cache: false`.
//! 2. **First-run model loading.** The RT-DETR layout engine is held in a single-slot,
//!    shape/config-keyed cache (`xberg::layout::take_or_create_engine`); switching
//!    `max_threads` changes the per-session thread budget, which is part of that cache key
//!    (`LayoutEngine::matches_config`), so every new sweep point forces one cold ONNX Runtime
//!    session load. Criterion's own warm-up phase runs the exact closure being measured before
//!    any sample is recorded, so that cold load lands in warm-up, not in the measured samples —
//!    but `warm_up_time` is set generously (10s) specifically to make sure the cold load
//!    finishes before sampling starts, and each `(cohort, threads)` pair is registered as its
//!    own `bench_function` so the cache is never invalidated mid-measurement.
//! 3. **ORT intra-op threads vs. document-worker count.** These are two different knobs and
//!    this benchmark must not conflate them. `resolve_batch_execution_plan` derives the
//!    document-level *worker* count (a `tokio::sync::Semaphore` permit count consumed by
//!    `extract_batch`'s `JoinSet` scheduling) independently of ONNX Runtime's *intra-op* thread
//!    count (set per-session via `with_intra_threads`, see `layout::session::build_session`).
//!    Raising `max_threads` for an all-layout-PDF batch changes the latter (more intra-op
//!    threads for the one active session) without changing the former (still one worker) — that
//!    split is exactly the documented claim, so both effects must be free to move independently.
//!    The confound to guard against is a *third*, unrelated pool: `xberg`'s global Rayon pool is
//!    initialized at most once per process (`core::config::concurrency::init_thread_pools` is
//!    guarded by a `std::sync::Once`), so if this benchmark's first extraction call happened to
//!    run at a small `max_threads`, every later sweep point sharing this process would be
//!    starved of Rayon threads regardless of its own configured budget — which would understate
//!    scaling for `non_layout_batch` for reasons that have nothing to do with the documented
//!    batch-worker policy. `warm_up_rayon_pool_at_max_threads` below forces that one-time
//!    initialization to happen at the *largest* swept thread budget before any measurement
//!    begins, so no sweep point is ever bottlenecked on an undersized shared pool. This makes
//!    the reported non-layout numbers, if anything, slightly conservative (small-budget samples
//!    have access to more shared-pool capacity than a fresh process would give them) rather than
//!    inflated — it cannot manufacture the scaling effect this benchmark is trying to detect,
//!    it can only hide it. If `non_layout_batch` still shows a flat line, that is a real,
//!    interesting finding.
//!

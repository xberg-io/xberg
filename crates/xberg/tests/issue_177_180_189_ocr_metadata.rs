//! Integration coverage for the Tesseract OCR execution-path fixes:
//!
//! - #177: table detection now clusters words into independent spatial regions
//!   instead of hardcoding `table_count`/`tables_detected` to at most one
//!   whole-page table. This test pins the metadata for a real single-table
//!   image so the refactor is proven not to regress the common case (no
//!   available fixture exercises two independent tables on one page).
//! - #180: words whose parent Tesseract block is a non-text block (noise, an
//!   embedded image region, a ruling line) are no longer dropped from
//!   `ocr_elements`; they are retained, tagged with their real `block_type`,
//!   and counted into the `non_text_block_word_count` metadata key.
//! - #189: `ResultIterator::extract_all_words` now forwards
//!   `TessResultIteratorWordRecognitionLanguage` per word, surfaced as
//!   `word_language` in each `OcrElement.backend_metadata`.
//! - #175/#191: block type, justification, and crown/list-item paragraph
//!   metadata are present on every word-level `OcrElement`.

// existing `test_hello_world.png` fixture:
//
//   * an 800x600 flat mid-grey page (grey, not white, so the extractor takes
//     the raw pass-through branch instead of the DPI-normalise + Leptonica
//     branch — that keeps the rendered pixels, and therefore Tesseract's
//     layout analysis, fully deterministic),
//   * the two words "Hello" and "World" cropped out of the fixture and
//     blended onto the grey page,
//   * a black diagonal band drawn across the page. Tesseract classifies the
//     band as `PT_FLOWING_IMAGE`, and because the band is diagonal its
//     *bounding box* spans the words, which the block lookup resolves before
//     it reaches the words' own text block.

// altogether, so Tesseract reports every word as `PT_FLOWING_TEXT` and the

// its own `tesseract_config` — classifies polyblocks at all.

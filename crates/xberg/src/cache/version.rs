//! Cache-key version tag folded into every on-disk cache key.
//!
//! A cached extraction result is only valid for the crate version, cache
//! schema, and *build* that produced it. Neither the content hash (bytes of
//! the input) nor the config hash (the `ExtractionConfig`) changes when
//! *extraction behaviour* changes — a fixed extractor, a reordered pipeline
//! stage, a new post-processor — so without this tag an entry written before
//! the fix is served forever, and the bug it encodes outlives its own fix.
//!
//! The tag mixes in four things:
//! - `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` — the crate version.
//! - [`CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`] — bumped by hand when a behaviour change is
//!   deliberately recognised as cache-affecting (see its own doc comment).
//! - `XBERG_BUILD_ID` — a best-effort per-build identifier baked in by
//!   `build.rs` (see that file's `build_id` for the full derivation and its
//!   git-SHA / dirty-tree / env-override precedence, and for the cases —
//!   Docker builds, crates.io/docs.rs tarball builds — where it is `""`).
//!   This is the safety net *under* [`CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`], not a
//!   replacement for it: most behaviour changes are never recognised as
//!   cache-affecting and so never get a manual schema bump, but they usually
//!   do land as a distinct commit, which `XBERG_BUILD_ID` catches without
//!   anyone having to remember.
//! - The debug/release profile bit (`cfg!(debug_assertions)`) — a debug and
//!   a release binary built from the identical commit must not silently
//!   share entries if they ever diverge in output; the bit costs nothing to
//!   include even when they don't.
//!
//! When `XBERG_BUILD_ID` is `""` (no git metadata and no override reached
//! the build), that component stops distinguishing anything: the tag's only
//! remaining discriminating power is crate version + schema version, plus
//! the profile bit above (new here regardless of `XBERG_BUILD_ID`) — the
//! same discriminating power the tag had before `XBERG_BUILD_ID` existed.
//! Note this changes the tag's *value*, not just what it discriminates on:
//! deploying this change invalidates every entry already on disk, the same
//! one-time effect as a [`CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION`] bump.
//!
//! Every cache key is therefore prefixed with this tag. Changing any of the
//! four inputs makes all previously written entries unreachable; they age
//! out through the normal cleanup pass.

/// Generation counter for cached extraction results.
///
/// Bump this whenever extraction output can change for an unchanged input and
/// an unchanged `ExtractionConfig` — that is, whenever a fix or a behaviour
/// change would otherwise be masked by an entry written before it landed.
/// Bumping it invalidates every existing cache entry process-wide.
/// Bumped for #687: the OCR cache key did not cover the Tesseract engine variables
/// `apply_tesseract_variables` applies (`crates/xberg/src/ocr/processor/config.rs`), so
/// entries written before `hocr_font_info` was enabled in 57e414a6db kept being served
/// after it landed, serving stale font-size data. `hash_config` now folds those variables
/// into its own hash, but this bump is still needed to invalidate the entries that were
/// already on disk before that fix.
///
/// Bumped for #783: `hocr_parser::parse_hocr_to_internal_document_with_dictionary_filter`
/// now drops per-line dictionary-invalid noise from the `InternalDocument`/`content` a
/// Tesseract "markdown"-format OCR call produces, for an unchanged image hash and config
/// hash (`hash_config` never covered this -- it is not a Tesseract engine variable, just a
/// call-site decision in `ocr::processor::execution::perform_ocr`). A prior attempt at
/// this exact fix (reverted as `29738a1f29`) was measured byte-identical with its new
/// threshold on vs. off. Its confirmed cause was representation drift -- it stripped only
/// `page_texts` while rendering reads paragraphs -- not this constant. But that commit
/// also failed to bump it, so a stale entry would have hidden a working fix just as
/// effectively, and the two are indistinguishable after the fact. Any A/B measuring this
/// fix MUST run against a cold cache -- see `ocr::cache::OcrCache`.
///
/// Bumped for the PDF OCR source-DPI fix: `extractors::pdf::ocr` now tells the Tesseract
/// backend the true resolution of each rendered page (`SOURCE_DPI_BACKEND_OPTION`), so
/// `image::preprocessing::normalize_image_dpi_owned` stops assuming 72 DPI for rasters
/// rendered at 150. Every PDF OCR page therefore produces a differently sized raster, a
/// different Tesseract `scan_res`, and different output for an unchanged input and config.
/// `hash_config` now folds `TesseractConfig::source_dpi` in, but that only separates future
/// entries from each other; the entries already on disk were written under the 72 assumption
/// with a key that cannot distinguish them, and this bump is what makes them unreachable. Any
/// A/B measuring this fix MUST run against a cold cache.
///
/// Bumped for the OCR page-number fix: `perform_ocr` (`ocr::processor::execution`) stamped
/// every returned element, table, and `OcrElement` with `1` regardless of which page of the
/// source document the image actually was, because Tesseract numbers every single-image call's
/// hOCR/TSV/iterator page as `0`/`1` internally (see `TesseractConfig::page_number`'s doc
/// comment). `hash_config` now folds `page_number` in, but that only separates future entries
/// from each other; entries already on disk were written with the always-`1` page baked into
/// their cached content and a key that cannot distinguish them, and this bump is what makes
/// them unreachable.
///
/// Bumped for built-in extractor provenance: successful built-in extraction now defaults a
/// missing or unrecognized `extraction_method` to `native`. Cached `ExtractedDocument` values
/// are returned before extractor dispatch, so schema-6 entries could otherwise retain `None`.
///
/// Bumped for plugin lifecycle generations: extraction cache entries now wrap the result with
/// the post-processor and validator registry generations that produced it. ~keep

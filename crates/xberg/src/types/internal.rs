//! Internal flat document representation.
//!
//! This module provides the internal DTO that all extractors output. It is a flat,
//! append-only structure optimized for extraction performance. The public
//! [`DocumentStructure`](super::document_structure::DocumentStructure) tree and
//! relationship graph are derived from this in a post-processing step.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **Flat `Vec<InternalElement>`**: Cache-friendly, append-only during extraction
//! - **Relationships stored separately**: Keeps element iteration compact
//! - **Optional container markers**: `ListStart`/`ListEnd` etc. improve tree derivation
//!   when present; depth-based heuristics used as fallback
//! - **OCR elements unified**: OCR text is just another element kind, not a parallel structure
//! - **Blake3 IDs**: Deterministic, collision-resistant identifiers

//! OCR functionality for PDF extraction.
//!
//! Handles text quality evaluation, OCR fallback decision logic, and OCR processing.
//!
//! Split into topical submodules: [`scoring`] (native-text/OCR-output quality evaluation and
//! the skip/fallback gate), [`plausibility`] (language/dictionary-plausibility detection for
//! wrong-mapped text layers, issue #1696), [`rendering`] (PDF page rasterization and
//! image-XObject recovery), [`document`] (bbox/geometry transforms and assembling OCR output
//! into page documents, including merging OCR pages back into a natively-extracted document),
//! and [`pipeline`] (the top-level mixed-OCR and per-page pipeline orchestrators). Items used
//! across submodule boundaries are `pub(super)`; items already reachable from outside `ocr`
//! keep their original visibility and are re-exported here so external call sites are
//! unaffected by the split. Unit tests live in `tests.rs`, `recognition_noise_tests.rs`,
//! `numeric_repair_tests.rs`, and `plausibility_tests.rs`, not inline here.

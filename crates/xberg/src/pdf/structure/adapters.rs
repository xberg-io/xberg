/// of the native one -- see `pipeline::DetachedMarkerFrame`.
///
/// Runs directly on the per-page paragraphs `ocr_doc_to_layout_paragraphs`

/// with no paragraph grouping left to exploit.
///
/// Unlike the native pass, this rebuilds `body.text` directly instead of clearing
/// it: `assemble_ocr_page_paragraphs` has no `synchronize_paragraph_text_metadata`
/// call after it to repopulate an emptied `.text`, and the eventual renderer
/// (`assembly::push_paragraph_element`) reads `.text` directly whenever it is

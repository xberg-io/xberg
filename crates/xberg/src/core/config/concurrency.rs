/// Set `max_threads` to cap all internal thread pools (Rayon, ONNX Runtime
/// intra-op), batch concurrency and Tesseract recognition to a single limit.
/// Set `max_concurrent_ocr` to give recognition a limit of its own, which is
/// the knob to reach for when the host has cores to spare but not the memory
/// to run a recognition session on each of them. It is applied as given and
/// is not capped by `max_threads`. The first extraction in a process fixes
/// it for that process — see the field's own documentation.
///
/// # Default budget when `max_threads` is unset
///
/// Without an explicit `max_threads`, the effective budget is
/// `min(detected_cpu_cores, 8)` — a deliberate ceiling chosen for
/// serverless/shared-tenant defaults, not a full-host auto-scale. On a host
/// with more than 8 cores this means the extra cores go **unused** unless one
/// of the following applies:
///
/// - `max_threads` is set explicitly above 8 (the only way to exceed the
///   ceiling on a bare-metal or VM host with no CPU quota).
/// - The process runs under a Linux cgroup CPU quota (containers, Kubernetes
///   `resources.limits.cpu`); in that case the quota itself is used as the
///   ceiling instead of the hardcoded 8, since the quota already reflects a
///   deliberately-configured resource limit.
///
/// When neither applies and the host has more than 8 cores, a single
/// `WARN`-level log is emitted the first time the budget is resolved,
/// naming the detected core count and the applied cap, so the ceiling is
/// discoverable without reading source.

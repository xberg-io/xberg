//! Memory-efficient safetensors loading for wasm32.
//!
//! `candle_core::safetensors::load_buffer` (used by the original
//! `from_buffered_safetensors` implementations) deserializes the safetensors
//! header, then eagerly materializes EVERY tensor in the file as an owned
//! F32 `Tensor` into one `HashMap<String, Tensor>` -- all at once, before any
//! dtype conversion happens. For a large encoder (this crate targets
//! DeBERTa-v2-scale GLiNER2 models with big embedding tables), that means
//! holding the full F32-sized model in memory simultaneously with the raw
//! safetensors byte buffer it was just downloaded into -- confirmed via a
//! live browser reproduction to exhaust wasm32 linear memory and crash with
//! `RuntimeError: unreachable` inside `std::alloc::rust_oom`, even though
//! the model's final (post-conversion) memory footprint would fit
//! comfortably.
//!
//! This loader instead uses `safetensors::SafeTensors::deserialize` directly
//! (zero-copy header parse -- no tensor allocation yet), then converts each
//! tensor to the target `dtype` ONE AT A TIME, dropping the transient F32
//! copy before moving to the next tensor. Peak memory is therefore: the raw
//! byte buffer (already resident, already paid for) + one transient F32
//! tensor + the growing target-dtype `HashMap` -- not raw buffer + full F32
//! HashMap + target-dtype HashMap all at once.
//!
//! For the F32->F16 case specifically (the only conversion this crate needs
//! on wasm32), even that one-transient-F32-tensor peak turned out to be too
//! much for large tensors: `candle_core::safetensors::Load::load` first
//! copies the view's raw bytes into an owned F32 `Tensor`/`Vec<f32>`, then
//! `to_dtype` allocates a SECOND owned buffer (`Vec<f16>`) and converts
//! element-by-element before the F32 one is dropped -- confirmed via a live
//! browser reproduction to intermittently OOM (`RuntimeError: unreachable`
//! in `rust_oom`) inside exactly this call, on exactly the largest tensor
//! (the token embedding table), even with the one-tensor-at-a-time loop
//! above. `convert_view_to_f16` below reads the view's raw little-endian
//! bytes directly and writes straight into the target `Vec<half::f16>` --
//! only ONE new heap allocation per tensor (the raw bytes are a borrow into
//! the already-resident safetensors buffer, not a copy), roughly halving
//! the transient peak for the file's largest tensors.

# Platform support matrix

Authoritative record of which prebuilt native artifacts each language binding ships, and the known
gaps. Source of truth is `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` — this table is derived from those build

## Known gaps & rationale

1. **Node · macOS x64 (Intel) — dropped (rc.23).** pyke ships no static x64-mac ORT, and
   Microsoft's last x86_64-macOS ONNX Runtime dylib is 1.23.2 (the CLI vendors that one), so at the
   time CI provisioned ORT via Homebrew, whose bottle dynamically links a ~252-lib abseil closure
   at absolute Homebrew paths. The self-containment vendor step
   (`scripts/ci/vendor-macos-node-dylibs.sh`) correctly rejected the non-portable package, and the
   Intel-mac node leg was dropped. Intel Mac users run the arm64 binding under Rosetta or use the
   WASM package. In **rc.22** this leg *failed* (so no node package published at all); the drop
   lands in **rc.23**.
2. **PHP** builds against **8.3, 8.4, 8.5** on every listed platform.
3. **Dart** ships the server-mode native; the full pub.dev package has a known size blocker (all-platform
   natives exceed the 100 MB cap) tracked separately — see the release notes.
4. **Zig** consumes the **C FFI** GitHub-release artifacts, so its platform coverage equals C FFI's.
5. **Swift** targets Apple platforms only — macOS (Apple Silicon) and iOS (arm64). Intel-mac
   (`include-macos-x86_64: false`) and iOS-simulator-x86_64 are excluded; there is no Linux or Windows
   SwiftPM artifact.
6. **Kotlin/Android** ships the two Android ABIs — `arm64-v8a` (devices) and `x86_64` (emulator).
   The x86_64-emulator native uses the ORT-free `android-target` feature set (no embeddings); RT-DETR
   layout detection, the wired/wireless table classifier, document-orientation detection, and classical
   PaddleOCR (detection, recognition, and textline-orientation classification) now all run on the
   x86_64 emulator too, through the pure-Rust `tract` engine (see note 8) instead of ORT. arm64 devices
   get the full ORT-enabled build.
7. **WASM** is a single `wasm32` artifact, portable across any WASM runtime (browser + Node). It uses
   the `wasm-target` feature set (`ocr-wasm`, `excel-wasm`, `layout-tract`, `auto-rotate-tract`,
   `ner-candle-wasm`; no native ORT, no tree-sitter). Layout detection and document-orientation run
   through the pure-Rust `tract` engine (see note 8); named-entity recognition runs in the browser
   through the pure-Rust candle GLiNER2 backend (see note 9).
8. **Pure-Rust `tract` engine.** Where a target cannot link native ONNX Runtime, xberg's inference seam
   can compile select ONNX models against the pure-Rust `tract` engine (`tract-onnx`, no native library,
   CPU-only — hardware acceleration / execution providers are an ORT-path-only concept, tract has no
   equivalent) instead. Document-orientation detection (`auto-rotate-tract`) and RT-DETR layout
   detection (plus the wired/wireless table classifier, with the `pdf` feature) run this way, matching
   ONNX Runtime within 5e-3 on their outputs, and are enabled for both `android-target` (so the x86_64
   Android emulator detects page orientation and layout for the first time) and `wasm-target`: the WASM
   build exposes `detectLayout` / `detectOrientation`, which take the `.onnx` weights as streamed bytes
   (the JS host fetches them and hands them to the seam). Classical PaddleOCR (DBNet detection, CRNN
   recognition, textline-orientation classification) also runs on tract via `paddle-ocr-tract`, enabled
   for `android-target` only so far (not yet `wasm-target`). tract is substantially slower than
   multi-threaded ORT for these models — roughly 11-19x on models measured to date — and PaddleOCR
   detection cost grows steeply with the page size tract renders (bounded by `det_limit_side_len`;
   the DBNet plan is pinned to each page's own resized extent and cached by shape, so detection
   results match ONNX Runtime exactly): the `medium` detection tier measured ~821 ms / 518 MiB at
   640², ~1650 ms / 981 MiB at 960², and ~4038 ms / 1652 MiB at 1280² (macOS arm64, single run,
   indicative), with the
   `mobile` tier 5-6x cheaper at every size. On tract targets, prefer the `mobile` detection tier with a
   lower `det_limit_side_len` (~640); the ORT-path default of 1024 is unchanged. TATR, SLANeXT, and
   PP-DocLayout-V3 remain ONNX Runtime-only.
9. **In-browser entity detection.** The WASM build exposes `NerModel`, which runs GLiNER2 named-entity
   recognition entirely inside the page — no server round-trip and no ONNX Runtime, through the
   pure-Rust candle backend (`ner-candle-wasm`, the no-tokio sibling of the native `ner-candle`).
   Weights are not embedded in the `.wasm`; the host fetches the safetensors, tokenizer, and encoder
   config and passes the bytes to `NerModel.load`. Unlike the byte-oriented `detectLayout` /
   `detectOrientation` functions, the model stays resident across calls, so the weights are parsed
   once. Inference is synchronous CPU work on a single-threaded target — run it in a Web Worker if
   main-thread responsiveness matters.
10. **Go musl** archives ship the dynamic `xberg-ffi` library and its vendored native-library closure.
    The generated setup command detects Alpine/musl automatically. Its `-link static` mode is available
    on glibc Linux, macOS, and Windows x64, but not on musl.

## Cross-cutting gaps

- **musl (Alpine):** shipped by **CLI, Java, C#, Elixir, Node, and Go**. Go's musl archive is
  dynamic-only (see note 10). Python, Ruby, PHP, Dart, C FFI, and Zig ship glibc-only Linux.
- **Windows:** every desktop binding ships Windows x64 **except Ruby** (no RubyGems Windows native) and
  the Apple/mobile/wasm bindings (n/a).
- **Intel Mac (macOS x64):** shipped by most bindings; **not** by Node (see gap ¹) or Swift.
- **Linux arm64 musl** exists only where full musl is listed (CLI/Java/C#/Elixir/Node/Go).

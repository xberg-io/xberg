## Configuration Reference

This page documents all configuration types and their defaults across all languages.

### AccelerationConfig

Hardware acceleration configuration for ONNX Runtime models.

Controls which execution provider (CPU, CoreML, CUDA, TensorRT) is used
for inference in layout detection and embedding generation.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `ExecutionProviderType` | `ExecutionProviderType.AUTO` | Execution provider to use for ONNX inference. |
| `device_id` | `int` | — | GPU device ID (for CUDA/TensorRT). Ignored for CPU/CoreML/Auto. |

---

### CaptioningConfig

Configuration for the VLM captioning post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `llm` | `LlmConfig` | — | LLM configuration used for the VLM call. |
| `prompt` | `str \| None` | `None` | Optional custom caption prompt. `None` uses the default `RegionKind.Caption` prompt that ships with `crate.llm.region_extractor`. |
| `min_image_area` | `int` | `serde(default = "default_min_image_area")` | Skip images whose `width * height` is below this threshold (in pixels). Default `1_000` filters out icons and decorations. |

---

### PageClassificationConfig

Configuration for the page-classification post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `prompt_template` | `str \| None` | `None` | Minijinja prompt template. Receives `{{ labels }}` (joined list), `{{ page_text }}` and `{{ multi_label }}` variables. `None` lets the backend pick a sensible default. |
| `labels` | `list\[str\]` | — | The set of labels the classifier may emit. Must contain at least one entry. |
| `multi_label` | `bool` | `/* serde(default) */` | Allow multiple labels per page. Single-label mode returns at most one label. |
| `llm` | `LlmConfig` | — | LLM configuration used for classification. |

---

### ContentFilterConfig

Cross-extractor content filtering configuration.

Controls whether "furniture" content (headers, footers, page numbers,
watermarks, repeating text) is included in or stripped from extraction
results. Applies across all extractors (PDF, DOCX, RTF, ODT, HTML, etc.)
with format-specific implementation.

When `None` on `ExtractionConfig`, each extractor uses its current
default behavior unchanged.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `include_headers` | `bool` | `False` | Include running headers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables top-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageHeader`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document headers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Headers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<header>` element content. Default: `False` (headers are stripped or excluded). |
| `include_footers` | `bool` | `False` | Include running footers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables bottom-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageFooter`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document footers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Footers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<footer>` element content. Default: `False` (footers are stripped or excluded). |
| `strip_repeating_text` | `bool` | `True` | Enable the heuristic cross-page repeating text detector. When `True` (default), text that repeats verbatim across a supermajority of pages is classified as furniture and stripped.  Disable this if brand names or repeated headings are being incorrectly removed by the heuristic. Note: when a layout-detection model is active, the model may independently classify page-header / page-footer regions as furniture on a per-page basis. To preserve those regions, set `include_headers = true`, `include_footers = true`, or both, in addition to disabling this flag. Primarily affects PDF extraction. Default: `True`. |
| `include_watermarks` | `bool` | `False` | Include watermark text in extraction output. - PDF: Keeps watermark artifacts and arXiv identifiers. - Other formats: No effect currently. Default: `False` (watermarks are stripped). |

---

### EmailConfig

Configuration for email extraction.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `msg_fallback_codepage` | `int \| None` | `None` | Windows codepage number to use when an MSG file contains no codepage property. Defaults to `None`, which falls back to windows-1252. If an unrecognized or invalid codepage number is supplied (including 0), the behavior silently falls back to windows-1252 — the same as when the MSG file itself contains an unrecognized codepage. No error or warning is emitted. Users should verify output when supplying unusual values. Common values: - 1250: Central European (Polish, Czech, Hungarian, etc.) - 1251: Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) - 1252: Western European (default) - 1253: Greek - 1254: Turkish - 1255: Hebrew - 1256: Arabic - 932:  Japanese (Shift-JIS) - 936:  Simplified Chinese (GBK) |

---

### ExtractionConfig

Main extraction configuration.

This struct contains all configuration options for the extraction process.
It can be loaded from TOML, YAML, or JSON files, or created programmatically.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `use_cache` | `bool` | `True` | Enable caching of extraction results |
| `enable_quality_processing` | `bool` | `True` | Enable quality post-processing |
| `ocr` | `OcrConfig \| None` | `None` | OCR configuration (None = OCR disabled) |
| `force_ocr` | `bool` | `False` | Force OCR even for searchable PDFs |
| `force_ocr_pages` | `list\[int\] \| None` | `None` | Force OCR on specific pages only (1-indexed page numbers, must be >= 1). When set, only the listed pages are OCR'd regardless of text layer quality. Unlisted pages use native text extraction. Ignored when `force_ocr` is `True`. Only applies to PDF documents. Duplicates are automatically deduplicated. An `ocr` config is recommended for backend/language selection; defaults are used if absent. |
| `disable_ocr` | `bool` | `False` | Disable OCR entirely, even for images. When `True`, OCR is skipped for all document types. Images return metadata only (dimensions, format, EXIF) without text extraction. PDFs use only native text extraction without OCR fallback. Cannot be `True` simultaneously with `force_ocr`. *Added in v4.7.0.* |
| `chunking` | `ChunkingConfig \| None` | `None` | Text chunking configuration (None = chunking disabled) |
| `content_filter` | `ContentFilterConfig \| None` | `None` | Content filtering configuration (None = use extractor defaults). Controls whether document "furniture" (headers, footers, watermarks, repeating text) is included in or stripped from extraction results. See `ContentFilterConfig` for per-field documentation. |
| `images` | `ImageExtractionConfig \| None` | `None` | Image extraction configuration (None = no image extraction) |
| `pdf_options` | `PdfConfig \| None` | `None` | PDF-specific options (None = use defaults) |
| `token_reduction` | `TokenReductionOptions \| None` | `None` | Token reduction configuration (None = no token reduction) |
| `language_detection` | `LanguageDetectionConfig \| None` | `None` | Language detection configuration (None = no language detection) |
| `pages` | `PageConfig \| None` | `None` | Page extraction configuration (None = no page tracking) |
| `keywords` | `KeywordConfig \| None` | `None` | Keyword extraction configuration (None = no keyword extraction) |
| `postprocessor` | `PostProcessorConfig \| None` | `None` | Post-processor configuration (None = use defaults) |
| `html_output` | `HtmlOutputConfig \| None` | `None` | Styled HTML output configuration. When set alongside `output_format = OutputFormat.Html`, the extraction pipeline uses `StyledHtmlRenderer` which emits stable `kb-*` CSS class hooks on every structural element and optionally embeds theme CSS or user-supplied CSS in a `<style>` block. When `None`, the existing plain comrak-based HTML renderer is used. |
| `extraction_timeout_secs` | `int \| None` | `None` | Default per-file timeout in seconds for batch extraction. When set, each file in a batch will be canceled after this duration unless overridden by `FileExtractionConfig.timeout_secs`. Defaults to `Some(60)` to prevent pathological files (e.g. deeply nested archives, documents with millions of cells) from running indefinitely and exhausting caller resources. Set to `None` to disable the timeout for trusted input or long-running workloads. |
| `max_concurrent_extractions` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum concurrent extractions in batch operations (None = (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil()). Limits parallelism to prevent resource exhaustion when processing large batches. Defaults to (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil() when not set. |
| `result_format` | `ResultFormat` | `ResultFormat.UNIFIED` | Result structure format Controls whether results are returned in unified format (default) with all content in the `content` field, or element-based format with semantic elements (for Unstructured-compatible output). |
| `security_limits` | `SecurityLimits \| None` | `None` | Security limits for archive extraction. Controls maximum archive size, compression ratio, file count, and other security thresholds to prevent decompression bomb attacks. Also caps nesting depth, iteration count, entity / token length, total content size, and table cell count for every extraction path that ingests user-controlled bytes. When `None`, default limits are used. |
| `max_embedded_file_bytes` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum uncompressed size in bytes for a single embedded file before recursive extraction is attempted (default: 50 MiB). Applies to embedded objects inside OOXML containers (DOCX, PPTX) and to email attachments processed via recursive extraction. Files that exceed this limit are skipped with a `ProcessingWarning` rather than passed to the extraction pipeline, preventing a single oversized embedded object from consuming unbounded memory or time. Set to `None` to disable the per-embedded-file cap (falls back to `security_limits.max_archive_size` as the only guard). |
| `output_format` | `OutputFormat` | `OutputFormat.PLAIN` | Content text format (default: Plain). Controls the format of the extracted content: - `Plain`: Raw extracted text (default) - `Markdown`: Markdown formatted output - `Djot`: Djot markup format (requires djot feature) - `Html`: HTML formatted output When set to a structured format, extraction results will include formatted output. The `formatted_content` field may be populated when format conversion is applied. |
| `layout` | `LayoutDetectionConfig \| None` | `None` | Layout detection configuration (None = layout detection disabled). When set, PDF pages and images are analyzed for document structure (headings, code, formulas, tables, figures, etc.) using RT-DETR models via ONNX Runtime. For PDFs, layout hints override paragraph classification in the markdown pipeline. For images, per-region OCR is performed with markdown formatting based on detected layout classes. Requires the `layout-detection` feature to run inference; the field is present whenever the `layout-types` feature is active (which includes `layout-detection` as well as the no-ORT target groups). |
| `transcription` | `TranscriptionConfig \| None` | `None` | Transcription (speech-to-text) configuration for audio/video files. When set and `enabled`, files with audio/video MIME types (mp3, mp4, m4a, wav, webm, etc.) are routed to the Whisper-based transcription pipeline. The actual heavy dependencies are only active under the `transcription` feature; the field is visible under `transcription-types` (including on WASM and Android targets that use the no-ORT preset). Default: `None` (transcription disabled). This is an additive, non-breaking change. |
| `use_layout_for_markdown` | `bool` | `False` | Run layout detection on the non-OCR PDF markdown path. When `True` and `layout` is `Some(_)`, layout regions inform heading, table, list, and figure detection in the structure pipeline that would otherwise rely on font-clustering heuristics alone. Significantly improves SF1 (structural F1) at the cost of inference latency (~150-300ms/page CPU, ~20-50ms/page GPU). Default: `False`. Requires the `layout-detection` feature. |
| `include_document_structure` | `bool` | `False` | Enable structured document tree output. When true, populates the `document` field on `ExtractionResult` with a hierarchical `DocumentStructure` containing heading-driven section nesting, table grids, content layer classification, and inline annotations. Independent of `result_format` — can be combined with Unified or ElementBased. |
| `acceleration` | `AccelerationConfig \| None` | `None` | Hardware acceleration configuration for ONNX Runtime models. Controls execution provider selection for layout detection and embedding models. When `None`, uses platform defaults (CoreML on macOS, CUDA on Linux, CPU on Windows). |
| `cache_namespace` | `str \| None` | `None` | Cache namespace for tenant isolation. When set, cache entries are stored under `{cache_dir}/{namespace}/`. Must be alphanumeric, hyphens, or underscores only (max 64 chars). Different namespaces have isolated cache spaces on the same filesystem. |
| `cache_ttl_secs` | `int \| None` | `None` | Per-request cache TTL in seconds. Overrides the global `max_age_days` for this specific extraction. When `0`, caching is completely skipped (no read or write). When `None`, the global TTL applies. |
| `email` | `EmailConfig \| None` | `None` | Email extraction configuration (None = use defaults). Currently supports configuring the fallback codepage for MSG files that do not specify one. See `EmailConfig` for details. |
| `url` | `UrlExtractionConfig` | — | URL ingestion and crawl configuration. |
| `max_archive_depth` | `int` | — | Maximum recursion depth for archive extraction (default: 3). Set to 0 to disable recursive extraction (legacy behavior). |
| `tree_sitter` | `TreeSitterConfig \| None` | `None` | Tree-sitter language pack configuration (None = tree-sitter disabled). When set, enables code file extraction using tree-sitter parsers. Controls grammar download behavior and code analysis options. |
| `structured_extraction` | `StructuredExtractionConfig \| None` | `None` | Structured extraction via LLM (None = disabled). When set, the extracted document content is sent to an LLM with the provided JSON schema. The structured response is stored in `ExtractionResult.structured_output`. |
| `ner` | `NerConfig \| None` | `None` | Named-entity recognition configuration. When set, the NER post-processor runs at the Middle stage and populates `ExtractionResult.entities`. |
| `redaction` | `RedactionConfig \| None` | `None` | Redaction / anonymisation configuration. When set, the redaction post-processor runs at the Late stage and rewrites every textual field in `ExtractionResult`, emitting an audit trail in `ExtractionResult.redaction_report`. |
| `summarization` | `SummarizationConfig \| None` | `None` | Summarisation configuration. When set, the summarisation post-processor runs at the Middle stage and populates `ExtractionResult.summary`. |
| `translation` | `TranslationConfig \| None` | `None` | Translation configuration. When set, the translation post-processor runs at the Middle stage and populates `ExtractionResult.translation`. |
| `page_classification` | `PageClassificationConfig \| None` | `None` | Per-page classification configuration. When set, the classification post-processor runs at the Middle stage and populates `ExtractionResult.page_classifications`. |
| `captioning` | `CaptioningConfig \| None` | `None` | VLM captioning configuration for extracted images. When set, the captioning post-processor runs at the Middle stage and writes a caption into each `ExtractedImage.caption`. |
| `qr_codes` | `bool \| None` | `None` | Enable QR-code detection in extracted images. When `True`, the QR post-processor runs at the Middle stage and populates `ExtractedImage.qr_codes`. |

### FileExtractionConfig

Per-file extraction configuration overrides for batch processing.

All fields are `Option<T>` — `None` means "use the batch-level default."
This type is used by `config` and `extract_batch`
to allow heterogeneous extraction settings within a single batch.

## Excluded Fields

The following `ExtractionConfig` fields are batch-level only and
cannot be overridden per file:

- `max_concurrent_extractions` — controls batch parallelism
- `use_cache` — global caching policy
- `acceleration` — shared ONNX execution provider
- `security_limits` — global archive security policy

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_quality_processing` | `bool \| None` | `None` | Override quality post-processing for this file. |
| `ocr` | `OcrConfig \| None` | `None` | Override OCR configuration for this file (None in the Option = use batch default). |

---

### SvgOptions

SVG-specific configuration for the image-encode pipeline.

Applies when the source image is SVG or when the output format is set to
`ImageOutputFormat.Svg`.  Available when the `svg` feature is active.

Used via `ImageExtractionConfig.svg`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sanitize` | `bool` | `True` | Run SVG bytes through `usvg` sanitization (strips external `href` attributes, JavaScript event handlers, and `foreignObject` elements) even when the output format is `Native`.  Defaults to `True`. |
| `render_dpi` | `float` | `96` | Target DPI when rasterizing SVG to a pixel-based format (PNG, JPEG, WebP, HEIF).  The tree's viewBox is scaled by `render_dpi / 96.0` before the pixel buffer is allocated.  Defaults to `96.0` (1× CSS pixel density). |

---

### ExtractInput

Unified extraction input for all public extraction entry points.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `kind` | `ExtractInputKind` | `ExtractInputKind.URI` | Source kind. `bytes` requires `bytes`; `uri` requires `uri`. |
| `bytes` | `bytes \| None` | `None` | Raw bytes for `kind = "bytes"`. |
| `uri` | `str \| None` | `None` | Local path, `file://` URI, or HTTP(S) URL for `kind = "uri"`. |
| `mime_type` | `str \| None` | `None` | MIME type hint. |
| `filename` | `str \| None` | `None` | Filename hint used for MIME detection and metadata. |
| `config` | `FileExtractionConfig \| None` | `None` | Per-input extraction overrides. |

---

### ExtractionSummary

Summary for a unified extraction call.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `inputs` | `int` | — | Number of inputs submitted by the caller. |
| `results` | `int` | — | Number of extraction results produced. |
| `errors` | `int` | — | Number of per-input errors. |
| `remote_urls` | `int` | — | Number of URI inputs that resolved to remote HTTP(S) URLs. |
| `pages_crawled` | `int` | — | Number of HTML pages crawled or scraped. |
| `documents_downloaded` | `int` | — | Number of downloaded non-HTML documents extracted from URLs. |

---

### ExtractionOutput

Unified extraction output envelope.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `results` | `list\[ExtractionResult\]` | `\[\]` | Extraction results in discovery order. |
| `errors` | `list\[ExtractionErrorItem\]` | `\[\]` | Non-fatal per-input errors. |
| `summary` | `ExtractionSummary` | — | Aggregate counts for the operation. |
| `crawl_final_urls` | `list\[str\]` | `\[\]` | Final URLs reached after redirects during URL ingestion. |
| `crawl_redirect_count` | `int` | — | Total redirects followed while fetching or crawling URLs. |
| `crawl_unique_normalized_urls` | `list\[str\]` | `\[\]` | Unique normalized URLs discovered by crawls. |

---

### UrlExtractionConfig

URL ingestion and crawl configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|

| `allow_local_file_inputs` | `bool` | `True` | Allow bare local filesystem path inputs. |
| `allow_file_uris` | `bool` | `True` | Allow local `file://` URI inputs. |

---

### ImageExtractionConfig

Image extraction configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `extract_images` | `bool` | `True` | Extract images from documents |
| `target_dpi` | `int` | `300` | Target DPI for image normalization |
| `max_image_dimension` | `int` | `4096` | Maximum dimension for images (width or height) |
| `inject_placeholders` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to inject image reference placeholders into markdown output. When `True` (default), image references like `!\[Image 1\](embedded:p1_i0)` are appended to the markdown. Set to `False` to extract images as data without polluting the markdown output. |
| `auto_adjust_dpi` | `bool` | `True` | Automatically adjust DPI based on image content |
| `min_dpi` | `int` | `72` | Minimum DPI threshold |
| `max_dpi` | `int` | `600` | Maximum DPI threshold |
| `max_images_per_page` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum number of image objects to extract per PDF page. Some PDFs (e.g. technical diagrams stored as thousands of raster fragments) can trigger extremely long or indefinite extraction times when every image object on a dense page is decoded individually via the PDF extractor. Setting this limit causes xberg to stop collecting individual images once the count per page reaches the cap and emit a warning instead. `None` (default) means no limit — all images are extracted. |
| `classify` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, extracted images are classified by kind and grouped into clusters where they appear to belong to one figure. Defaults to `False` — opt in explicitly to avoid unexpected ML overhead. |
| `include_page_rasters` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, full-page renders produced during OCR preprocessing are captured and returned as `ImageKind.PageRaster` entries in `ExtractionResult.images`. **PDF + OCR only.** No rasters are captured for non-PDF inputs or when the document-level OCR bypass is active (whole-document backend). When OCR is enabled and this flag is set but the active backend skips per-page rendering, a `ProcessingWarning` is emitted in `ExtractionResult.processing_warnings`. Defaults to `False`. Enable when downstream consumers need page thumbnails (e.g. citation previews, visual grounding). |
| `run_ocr_on_images` | `bool` | `True` | Run OCR on extracted images and include the recognized text in the document content. When `True` (default) and `ExtractionConfig.ocr` is configured, extracted images are processed with the configured OCR backend. Set to `False` to extract images without OCR processing, even when OCR is enabled. |
| `ocr_text_only` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, image OCR results are rendered as plain text without the `!\[...\](...)` markdown placeholder. Only takes effect when `run_ocr_on_images` is also `True`. |
| `append_ocr_text` | `bool` | `False` | When `True` and `ocr_text_only` is `False`, append the OCR text after the image placeholder in the rendered output. |
| `output_format` | `ImageOutputFormat` | `ImageOutputFormat.NATIVE` | Target format for re-encoding extracted images. When set to anything other than `Native`, each extracted image is re-encoded to the requested format before being returned. This lets callers receive uniform output without duplicating encode logic downstream. Defaults to `Native` — no re-encode pass is performed and `ExtractedImage.format` reflects the source extractor's output. |
| `svg` | `SvgOptions` | — | SVG-specific knobs for the image-encode pipeline. Controls sanitization and rasterization DPI when the source or output format is SVG.  Only available when the `svg` feature is active. |
| `include_data_base64` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, populate `ExtractedImage.data_base64` with a Base64-encoded copy of the raw image bytes. Useful for JSON-only clients that cannot efficiently parse the default integer-array serialization of `data`. Defaults to `False`; enabling it doubles the in-memory image representation for the duration of the response. |

---

### TokenReductionOptions

Token reduction configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `str` | — | Reduction mode: "off", "light", "moderate", "aggressive", "maximum" |
| `preserve_important_words` | `bool` | `True` | Preserve important words (capitalized, technical terms) |

---

### LanguageDetectionConfig

Language detection configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Enable language detection |
| `min_confidence` | `float` | `0.8` | Minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0) |
| `detect_multiple` | `bool` | `False` | Detect multiple languages in the document |

---

### HtmlOutputConfig

Configuration for styled HTML output.

When set on `html_output` alongside
`output_format = OutputFormat.Html`, the pipeline builds a
`StyledHtmlRenderer` instead of
the plain comrak-based renderer.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `css` | `str \| None` | `None` | Inline CSS string injected into the output after the theme stylesheet. Concatenated after `css_file` content when both are set. |
| `css_file` | `str \| None` | `None` | Path to a CSS file loaded once at renderer construction time. Concatenated before `css` when both are set. |
| `theme` | `HtmlTheme` | `HtmlTheme.UNSTYLED` | Built-in colour/typography theme. Default: `HtmlTheme.Unstyled`. |
| `class_prefix` | `str` | — | CSS class prefix applied to every emitted class name. Default: `"kb-"`. Change this if your host application already uses classes that start with `kb-`. |
| `embed_css` | `bool` | `True` | When `True` (default), write the resolved CSS into a `<style>` block immediately after the opening `<div class="{prefix}doc">`. Set to `False` to emit only the structural markup and wire up your own stylesheet targeting the `kb-*` class names. |

---

### LayoutDetectionConfig

Layout detection configuration.

Controls layout detection behavior in the extraction pipeline.
When set on `ExtractionConfig`, layout detection
is enabled for PDF extraction.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `confidence_threshold` | `float \| None` | `None` | Confidence threshold override (None = use model default). |
| `apply_heuristics` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to apply postprocessing heuristics (default: true). |
| `table_model` | `TableModel` | `TableModel.TATR` | Table structure recognition model. Controls which model is used for table cell detection within layout-detected table regions. Defaults to `TableModel.Tatr`. |
| `acceleration` | `AccelerationConfig \| None` | `None` | Hardware acceleration for ONNX models (layout detection + table structure). When set, controls which execution provider (CPU, CUDA, CoreML, TensorRT) is used for inference. Defaults to `None` (auto-select per platform). |
| `enable_chart_understanding` | `bool` | `False` | Route regions classified as charts to the chart-understanding OCR task. When `True`, layout regions detected as charts are sent to the VLM chart task (data-series/axis recovery) instead of being treated as generic image regions. Defaults to `False` — chart understanding is opt-in and has no effect on standard text/table extraction scores. |

---

### LlmConfig

Configuration for an LLM provider/model via liter-llm.

Each feature (VLM OCR, VLM embeddings, structured extraction) carries
its own `LlmConfig`, allowing different providers per feature.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | `str` | — | Provider/model string using liter-llm routing format. Examples: `"openai/gpt-4o"`, `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"`, `"groq/llama-3.1-70b-versatile"`. |
| `api_key` | `str \| None` | `None` | API key for the provider. When `None`, liter-llm falls back to the provider's standard environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`). |
| `base_url` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom base URL override for the provider endpoint. |
| `timeout_secs` | `int \| None` | `None` | Request timeout in seconds (default: 60). |
| `max_retries` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum retry attempts (default: 3). |
| `temperature` | `float \| None` | `None` | Sampling temperature for generation tasks. |
| `max_tokens` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum tokens to generate. |

---

### StructuredExtractionConfig

Configuration for LLM-based structured data extraction.

Sends extracted document content to a VLM with a JSON schema,
returning structured data that conforms to the schema.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `schema` | `dict\[str, Any\]` | — | JSON Schema defining the desired output structure. |
| `schema_name` | `str` | `serde(default = "default_schema_name")` | Schema name passed to the LLM's structured output mode. |
| `schema_description` | `str \| None` | `/* serde(default) */` | Optional schema description for the LLM. |
| `strict` | `bool` | `/* serde(default) */` | Enable strict mode — output must exactly match the schema. |
| `prompt` | `str \| None` | `/* serde(default) */` | Custom Jinja2 extraction prompt template. When `None`, a default template is used. Available template variables: - `{{ content }}` — The extracted document text. - `{{ schema }}` — The JSON schema as a formatted string. - `{{ schema_name }}` — The schema name. - `{{ schema_description }}` — The schema description (may be empty). |
| `llm` | `LlmConfig` | — | LLM configuration for the extraction. |

---

### NerConfig

Configuration for the NER post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `backend` | `NerBackendKind` | `NerBackendKind.ONNX` | Backend that runs the entity detection. |
| `categories` | `list\[EntityCategory\]` | `\[\]` | Entity categories to detect. Defaults to a sensible PERSON/ORG/LOCATION/EMAIL set when empty. |
| `model` | `str \| None` | `None` | Override the default model — only used by `NerBackendKind.Onnx`. `None` lets the backend pick its pinned default xberg GLiNER model alias. |
| `llm` | `LlmConfig \| None` | `None` | Optional LLM configuration — only used by `NerBackendKind.Llm`. Token usage for LLM backends is recorded in `ExtractionResult.llm_usage`. |
| `custom_labels` | `list\[str\]` | `\[\]` | Arbitrary user-supplied entity labels for zero-shot detection. `xberg-gliner` natively supports zero-shot inference over caller-supplied labels. The LLM backend also honours these labels by including them in the structured-output schema. Custom labels surface as `EntityCategory.Custom` in the resulting `Entity` stream. Use this when you need domain-specific entity types (e.g. `"Treatment"`, `"Product"`, `"Vessel"`) without forking GLiNER's taxonomy. |

---

### OcrQualityThresholds

Quality thresholds for OCR fallback decisions and pipeline quality gating.

All fields default to the values that match the previous hardcoded behavior,
so `OcrQualityThresholds.default()` preserves existing semantics exactly.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `min_total_non_whitespace` | `int` | `64` | Minimum total non-whitespace characters to consider text substantive. |
| `min_non_whitespace_per_page` | `float` | `32` | Minimum non-whitespace characters per page on average. |
| `min_meaningful_word_len` | `int` | `4` | Minimum character count for a word to be "meaningful". |
| `min_meaningful_words` | `int` | `3` | Minimum count of meaningful words before text is accepted. |
| `min_alnum_ratio` | `float` | `0.3` | Minimum alphanumeric ratio (non-whitespace chars that are alphanumeric). |
| `min_garbage_chars` | `int` | `5` | Minimum Unicode replacement characters (U+FFFD) to trigger OCR fallback. |
| `max_fragmented_word_ratio` | `float` | `0.6` | Maximum fraction of short (1-2 char) words before text is considered fragmented. |
| `critical_fragmented_word_ratio` | `float` | `0.8` | Critical fragmentation threshold — triggers OCR regardless of meaningful words. Normal English text has ~20-30% short words. 80%+ is definitive garbage. |
| `min_avg_word_length` | `float` | `2` | Minimum average word length. Below this with enough words indicates garbled extraction. |
| `min_words_for_avg_length_check` | `int` | `50` | Minimum word count before average word length check applies. |
| `min_consecutive_repeat_ratio` | `float` | `0.08` | Minimum consecutive word repetition ratio to detect column scrambling. |
| `min_words_for_repeat_check` | `int` | `50` | Minimum word count before consecutive repetition check is applied. |
| `substantive_min_chars` | `int` | `100` | Minimum character count for "substantive markdown" OCR skip gate. |
| `non_text_min_chars` | `int` | `20` | Minimum character count for "non-text content" OCR skip gate. |
| `alnum_ws_ratio_threshold` | `float` | `0.4` | Alphanumeric+whitespace ratio threshold for skip decisions. |
| `pipeline_min_quality` | `float` | `0.5` | Minimum quality score (0.0-1.0) for a pipeline stage result to be accepted. If the result from a backend scores below this, try the next backend. |

---

### OcrPipelineConfig

Multi-backend OCR pipeline with quality-based fallback.

Backends are tried in priority order (highest first). After each backend
produces output, quality is evaluated. If it meets `quality_thresholds.pipeline_min_quality`,
the result is accepted. Otherwise the next backend is tried.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `stages` | `list\[OcrPipelineStage\]` | — | Ordered list of backends to try. Sorted by priority (descending) at runtime. |
| `quality_thresholds` | `OcrQualityThresholds` | `/* serde(default) */` | Quality thresholds for deciding whether to accept a result or try the next backend. |

---

### OcrConfig

OCR configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Whether OCR is enabled. Setting `enabled: false` is a shorthand for `disable_ocr: true` on the parent `ExtractionConfig`. Images return metadata only; PDFs use native text extraction without OCR fallback. Defaults to `True`. When `False`, all other OCR settings are ignored. |
| `backend` | `str` | — | OCR backend: tesseract, easyocr, paddleocr |
| `language` | `list\[str\]` | `\[\]` | Language code(s) for OCR recognition. Accepts either a single language code ("eng") or a list (\["eng", "deu"\]). Defaults to \["eng"\]. For Tesseract, languages are joined with "+". |
| `tesseract_config` | `TesseractConfig \| None` | `None` | Tesseract-specific configuration (optional) |
| `output_format` | `OutputFormat \| None` | `None` | Output format for OCR results (optional, for format conversion) |
| `paddle_ocr_config` | `dict\[str, Any\] \| None` | `None` | PaddleOCR-specific configuration (optional, JSON passthrough) |
| `backend_options` | `dict\[str, Any\] \| None` | `None` | Arbitrary per-call options passed through to the backend unchanged. Custom OCR backends and built-in backends that support runtime tuning can read this value and deserialize the keys they care about. Keys unknown to the backend are silently ignored. This is the recommended extension point for per-call parameters that are not covered by the typed fields above (e.g. mode switching, preprocessing flags, inference batch size). **Scope:** when `pipeline` is `None`, this value is propagated to the primary stage of the auto-constructed pipeline. When `pipeline` is explicitly set, this field has **no effect** — the caller must set `OcrPipelineStage.backend_options` directly on the relevant stage(s) instead. Example: ```json { "mode": "fast", "enable_layout": true, "timeout_ms": 5000 } ``` |
| `element_config` | `OcrElementConfig \| None` | `None` | OCR element extraction configuration |
| `quality_thresholds` | `OcrQualityThresholds \| None` | `None` | Quality thresholds for the native-text-to-OCR fallback decision. When None, uses compiled defaults (matching previous hardcoded behavior). |
| `pipeline` | `OcrPipelineConfig \| None` | `None` | Multi-backend OCR pipeline configuration. When set, enables weighted fallback across multiple OCR backends based on output quality. When None, uses the single `backend` field (same as today). |
| `auto_rotate` | `bool` | `False` | Enable automatic page rotation based on orientation detection. When enabled, uses Tesseract's `DetectOrientationScript()` to detect page orientation (0/90/180/270 degrees) before OCR. If the page is rotated with high confidence, the image is corrected before recognition. This is critical for handling rotated scanned documents. |
| `vlm_fallback` | `VlmFallbackPolicy` | `VlmFallbackPolicy.DISABLED` | Ergonomic VLM fallback policy. When set to anything other than `VlmFallbackPolicy.Disabled` and `OcrConfig.pipeline` is `None`, a multi-stage pipeline is synthesised automatically: - `VlmFallbackPolicy.OnLowQuality` → `\[classical_stage, vlm_stage\]` with the `quality_threshold` mapped onto `OcrQualityThresholds.pipeline_min_quality`. - `VlmFallbackPolicy.Always` → `\[vlm_stage\]` only. Requires `OcrConfig.vlm_config` to be `Some` when not `Disabled`. When `OcrConfig.pipeline` is explicitly set, this field is ignored. |
| `vlm_config` | `LlmConfig \| None` | `None` | VLM (Vision Language Model) OCR configuration. Required when `backend` is `"vlm"` or when `vlm_fallback` is not `VlmFallbackPolicy.Disabled`. Uses liter-llm to send page images to a vision model for text extraction. |
| `vlm_prompt` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom Jinja2 prompt template for VLM OCR. When `None`, uses the default template. Available variables: - `{{ language }}` — The document language code (e.g., "eng", "deu"). |
| `acceleration` | `AccelerationConfig \| None` | `None` | Hardware acceleration for ONNX Runtime models (e.g. PaddleOCR, layout detection). Not user-configurable via config files — injected at runtime from `ExtractionConfig.acceleration` before each `process_image` call. |
| `tessdata_bytes` | `dict\[str, bytes\] \| None` | `None` | Caller-supplied Tesseract `traineddata` bytes per language code. Primary use case is the WASM build, which has no filesystem and cannot download tessdata at runtime. Native builds typically rely on `TessdataManager` and ignore this field. When present, the WASM Tesseract backend prefers these bytes over its compile-time-bundled English data. Skipped by serde to keep config files small — supply via the typed API at runtime. |
| `tessdata_path` | `str \| None` | `None` | Runtime override for tessdata directory path. When set, uses this path as the highest-priority tessdata location, bypassing environment variables and cache directories. Useful for embedding pre-installed tessdata in applications. When `None`, uses the standard resolution chain: TESSDATA_PREFIX env, cache dir, system paths. |

---

### PageConfig

Page extraction and tracking configuration.

Controls how pages are extracted, tracked, and represented in the extraction results.
When `None`, page tracking is disabled.

Page range tracking in chunk metadata (first_page/last_page) is automatically enabled
when page boundaries are available and chunking is configured.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `extract_pages` | `bool` | `False` | Extract pages as separate array (ExtractionResult.pages) |
| `insert_page_markers` | `bool` | `False` | Insert page markers in main content string |
| `marker_format` | `str` | `"<!-- PAGE {page_num} -->"` | Page marker format (use {page_num} placeholder) Default: "\n\n<!-- PAGE {page_num} -->\n\n" |

---

### PdfConfig

PDF-specific configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `extract_images` | `bool` | `False` | Extract images from PDF |
| `extract_tables` | `bool` | `True` | Extract tables from PDF. When `True` (default), runs pdf_oxide's native grid detector and, if it finds nothing, falls back to the heuristic text-layer reconstruction in `pdf.oxide.table.extract_tables_heuristic`. Set to `False` to skip both passes — `tables` will then be empty in the result. |
| `passwords` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | List of passwords to try when opening encrypted PDFs |
| `extract_metadata` | `bool` | `True` | Extract PDF metadata |
| `hierarchy` | `HierarchyConfig \| None` | `None` | Hierarchy extraction configuration (None = hierarchy extraction disabled) |
| `extract_annotations` | `bool` | `False` | Extract PDF annotations (text notes, highlights, links, stamps). Default: false |
| `top_margin_fraction` | `float \| None` | `None` | Top margin fraction (0.0–1.0) of page height to exclude headers/running heads. Default: 0.06 (6%) |
| `bottom_margin_fraction` | `float \| None` | `None` | Bottom margin fraction (0.0–1.0) of page height to exclude footers/page numbers. Default: 0.05 (5%) |
| `allow_single_column_tables` | `bool` | `False` | Allow single-column pseudo tables in extraction results. By default, tables with fewer than 2 columns (layout-guided) or 3 columns (heuristic) are rejected. When `True`, the minimum column count is relaxed to 1, allowing single-column structured data (glossaries, itemized lists) to be emitted as tables. Other quality filters (density, sparsity, prose detection) still apply. |
| `ocr_inline_images` | `bool` | `False` | Perform OCR on inline images extracted from PDF pages and attach the recognized text to each `ExtractedImage.ocr_result`. Requires Tesseract to be available; if `ExtractionConfig.ocr` is `None` the extractor falls back to `TesseractConfig.default()`. Per-image failures degrade gracefully (the image is returned without OCR text rather than failing the whole extraction). Default: `False`. |
| `extract_form_fields` | `bool` | `True` | Extract AcroForm and XFA form fields into `ExtractionResult.form_fields`. When `True` (default), reads the document's interactive form structure (field names, types, values, widget geometry). Cheap and strictly additive — non-form PDFs simply yield an empty list. Set to `False` to skip the form pass entirely. |
| `reading_order` | `bool` | `False` | Reorder extracted text by layout-detected reading order. When `True`, projects text spans onto layout-detected regions, performs column detection, and emits spans in natural reading order (important for multi-column academic PDFs). Requires the `layout-detection` feature; has no effect without it. Defaults to `False`. |

---

### HierarchyConfig

Hierarchy extraction configuration for PDF text structure analysis.

Enables extraction of document hierarchy levels (H1-H6) based on font size
clustering and semantic analysis. When enabled, hierarchical blocks are
included in page content.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Enable hierarchy extraction |
| `k_clusters` | `int` | `3` | Number of font size clusters to use for hierarchy levels (1-7) Default: 6, which provides H1-H6 heading levels with body text. Larger values create more fine-grained hierarchy levels. |
| `include_bbox` | `bool` | `True` | Include bounding box information in hierarchy blocks |
| `ocr_coverage_threshold` | `float \| None` | `None` | OCR coverage threshold for smart OCR triggering (0.0-1.0) Determines when OCR should be triggered based on text block coverage. OCR is triggered when text blocks cover less than this fraction of the page. Default: 0.5 (trigger OCR if less than 50% of page has text) |

---

### PostProcessorConfig

Post-processor configuration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Enable post-processors |
| `enabled_processors` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Whitelist of processor names to run (None = all enabled) |
| `disabled_processors` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Blacklist of processor names to skip (None = none disabled) |
| `enabled_set` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Pre-computed AHashSet for O(1) enabled processor lookup |
| `disabled_set` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Pre-computed AHashSet for O(1) disabled processor lookup |

---

### ChunkingConfig

Chunking configuration.

Configures text chunking for document content, including chunk size,
overlap, trimming behavior, and optional embeddings.

Use `..the default constructor` when constructing to allow for future field additions:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_characters` | `int` | `1000` | Maximum size per chunk (in units determined by `sizing`). When `sizing` is `Characters` (default), this is the max character count. When using token-based sizing, this is the max token count. Default: 1000 |
| `overlap` | `int` | `200` | Overlap between chunks (in units determined by `sizing`). Default: 200 |
| `trim` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to trim whitespace from chunk boundaries. Default: true |
| `chunker_type` | `ChunkerType` | `ChunkerType.TEXT` | Type of chunker to use (Text or Markdown). Default: Text |
| `embedding` | `EmbeddingConfig \| None` | `None` | Optional embedding configuration for chunk embeddings. |
| `preset` | `str \| None` | `None` | Use a preset configuration (overrides individual settings if provided). |
| `sizing` | `ChunkSizing` | `ChunkSizing.CHARACTERS` | How to measure chunk size. Default: `Characters` (Unicode character count). Enable `chunking-tiktoken` or `chunking-tokenizers` features for token-based sizing. |
| `prepend_heading_context` | `bool` | `False` | When `True` and `chunker_type` is `Markdown`, prepend the heading hierarchy path (e.g. `"# Title > ## Section\n\n"`) to each chunk's content string. This is useful for RAG pipelines where each chunk needs self-contained context about its position in the document structure. Default: `False` |
| `topic_threshold` | `float \| None` | `None` | Optional cosine similarity threshold for semantic topic boundary detection. Only used when `chunker_type` is `Semantic` and an `EmbeddingConfig` is provided. You almost never need to set this. When omitted, defaults to `0.75` which works well for most documents. Lower values detect more topic boundaries (more, smaller chunks); higher values detect fewer. Range: `0.0..=1.0`. |
| `table_chunking` | `TableChunkingMode` | `TableChunkingMode.SPLIT` | How to handle markdown tables that exceed the chunk size limit. Only applies when `chunker_type` is `Markdown`. - `Split` (default) — tables are split at row boundaries; continuation chunks do not repeat the header. - `RepeatHeader` — the table header row and separator are prepended to every continuation chunk so each chunk is self-contained. Default: `Split` |

---

### EmbeddingConfig

Embedding configuration for text chunks.

Configures embedding generation using ONNX models via the vendored embedding engine.
Requires the `embeddings` feature to be enabled.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | `EmbeddingModelType` | `EmbeddingModelType.PRESET` | The embedding model to use (defaults to "balanced" preset if not specified) |
| `normalize` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to normalize embedding vectors (recommended for cosine similarity) |
| `batch_size` | `int` | `32` | Batch size for embedding generation |
| `show_download_progress` | `bool` | `False` | Show model download progress |
| `cache_dir` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom cache directory for model files Defaults to `~/.cache/xberg/embeddings/` if not specified. Allows full customization of model download location. |
| `acceleration` | `AccelerationConfig \| None` | `None` | Hardware acceleration for the embedding ONNX model. When set, controls which execution provider (CPU, CUDA, CoreML, TensorRT) is used for inference. Defaults to `None` (auto-select per platform). |
| `max_embed_duration_secs` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum wall-clock duration (in seconds) for a single `embed()` call when using `EmbeddingModelType.Plugin`. Applies only to the in-process plugin path — protects against hung host-language backends (e.g. a Python callback deadlocked on the GIL, a model stuck on CUDA OOM retries, etc.). On timeout, the dispatcher returns `Plugin` instead of blocking forever. `None` disables the timeout. The default (60 seconds) is conservative for common in-process inference; increase for large batches on slow hardware. |

---

### RedactionConfig

Configuration for the redaction post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `categories` | `list\[PiiCategory\]` | `\[\]` | Categories to redact. Empty means "every category supported by the engine." |
| `strategy` | `RedactionStrategy` | `RedactionStrategy.MASK` | Strategy applied to every match. |
| `ner` | `NerConfig \| None` | `None` | Optional NER backend — required to redact PERSON / ORGANIZATION / LOCATION categories (the pure-Rust pattern engine only covers regex-detectable PII). |
| `preserve_offsets` | `bool` | `True` | When `True`, chunk byte ranges are kept consistent with the rewritten content by adjusting `byte_start` / `byte_end` after replacement. When `False`, chunk byte ranges still refer to the *original* content offsets — useful when downstream consumers want to map findings back to the original document. |
| `custom_terms` | `list\[RedactionTerm\]` | `\[\]` | Arbitrary user-supplied literal terms to redact. Each term is treated as a regex hit against the document, surfacing as `PiiCategory.Custom(label)` in `RedactionFinding` where `label` is the per-term label (defaulting to the literal value itself). Case-insensitive by default; set `RedactionTerm.case_sensitive` for exact match. Use this when you need to redact tenant-specific tokens (employee IDs, project codes, internal product names) without writing a custom plugin. |
| `custom_patterns` | `list\[RedactionPattern\]` | `\[\]` | Arbitrary user-supplied regex patterns to redact. Same surfacing semantics as `custom_terms`: each hit becomes a `PiiCategory.Custom(label)` finding. Patterns are validated at config-construction time via `RedactionConfig.validate`. |

---

### RerankerConfig

Configuration for the reranking pipeline.

Controls which model to use, how many results to return, and download/cache
behavior for local ONNX models.

Since v5.0.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | `RerankerModelType` | `RerankerModelType.PRESET` | The reranker model to use (defaults to "balanced" preset if not specified). |
| `top_k` | `int \| None` | `None` | Return at most this many documents. `None` returns all. Applied after sorting by score, so the highest-scoring documents are kept. |
| `batch_size` | `int` | `32` | Batch size for local ONNX cross-encoder inference. |
| `show_download_progress` | `bool` | `False` | Show model download progress (local ONNX path only). |
| `cache_dir` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom cache directory for model files. Defaults to `~/.cache/xberg/rerankers/` if not specified. |
| `acceleration` | `AccelerationConfig \| None` | `None` | Hardware acceleration for the reranker ONNX model. Controls which execution provider (CPU, CUDA, CoreML, TensorRT) is used for local inference. Defaults to `None` (auto-select per platform). |
| `max_rerank_duration_secs` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum wall-clock duration (in seconds) for a single `rerank()` call when using `RerankerModelType.Plugin`. Applies only to the in-process plugin path — protects against hung host-language backends. On timeout, the dispatcher returns `Plugin` instead of blocking forever. `None` disables the timeout. The default (60 seconds) is conservative for common in-process inference; increase for large document sets on slow hardware. |

---

### SummarizationConfig

Configuration for the summarisation post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `strategy` | `SummaryStrategy` | `SummaryStrategy.EXTRACTIVE` | Summarisation strategy. |
| `max_tokens` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum summary length in tokens. `None` lets the backend pick a default. |
| `llm` | `LlmConfig \| None` | `None` | LLM configuration for the abstractive backend. Ignored when `strategy = Extractive`. Required when `strategy = Abstractive`. |

---

### TranscriptionConfig

Configuration for audio/video transcription (speech-to-text).

When present and `enabled`, Xberg will route audio and video files
(mp3, mp4, m4a, wav, webm, etc.) through the transcription pipeline.

The heavy dependencies (ORT, hf-hub, symphonia) are only pulled when the
`transcription` feature is enabled. The config struct itself is available
under `transcription-types` so that `ExtractionConfig` round-trips on all
targets.

All fields have sensible defaults. The recommended starting point is:

```toml
[extraction.transcription]
enabled = true
model = "tiny"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Master switch. When false the block is ignored and audio files fall back to the normal "unsupported format" path. |
| `model` | `WhisperModel` | `WhisperModel.TINY` | Whisper model size to use. Smaller = faster + lower memory. `tiny` is the pragmatic default for first-time users and CI. |
| `language` | `str \| None` | `None` | Optional language hint (ISO-639-1 code, e.g. "en", "de"). When `None` (default), the current engine falls back to English. For deterministic production output, always set this explicitly. |
| `timestamps` | `bool` | `False` | Whether to request segment-level timestamps. Accepted for forward compatibility. The current engine always uses `<\|notimestamps\|>` and does not emit segment metadata yet. |
| `max_duration_ms` | `int \| None` | `None` | Hard safety limit on input duration (milliseconds). Files longer than this are rejected after decode, before model work. Default: 30 minutes. Set to `None` to disable (not recommended for untrusted input). |
| `max_bytes` | `int \| None` | `None` | Hard safety limit on input size (bytes). Default: 512 MiB. Protects against pathological or malicious uploads. |
| `timeout_ms` | `int \| None` | `None` | Wall-clock timeout for the entire transcription operation (ms). Default: 10 minutes. Reserved for timeout enforcement; the current extractor does not enforce this field yet. |
| `model_cache_dir` | `str \| None` | `None` | Override the directory used for Whisper model cache. When `None`, uses the centralized resolver: `XBERG_CACHE_DIR/whisper` or the platform default (`~/.cache/xberg/whisper` on Linux, etc.). |
| `allow_network` | `bool` | `True` | Allow network access to download models from Hugging Face Hub. When `False`, only previously cached models may be used. Useful for air-gapped or fully offline deployments. |
| `verify_hash` | `bool` | `True` | Request SHA256 verification of downloaded model files. Reserved for the checksum table follow-up. The current resolver logs a warning and treats this as a no-op. |

---

### TranslationConfig

Configuration for the translation post-processor.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `target_lang` | `str` | — | BCP-47 language tag for the target language (e.g. `"de"`, `"fr-CA"`). |
| `source_lang` | `str \| None` | `None` | Optional explicit source language. `None` asks the backend to auto-detect. |
| `preserve_markup` | `bool` | `/* serde(default) */` | Translate the formatted (Markdown/HTML) rendition alongside plain text when `formatted_content` is present. |
| `llm` | `LlmConfig` | — | LLM configuration used for translation. |

---

### TreeSitterConfig

Configuration for tree-sitter language pack integration.

Controls grammar download behavior and code analysis options.

## Example (TOML)

```toml
[tree_sitter]
languages = ["python", "rust"]
groups = ["web"]

[tree_sitter.process]
structure = true
comments = true
docstrings = true
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | Enable code intelligence processing (default: true). When `False`, tree-sitter analysis is completely skipped even if the config section is present. |
| `cache_dir` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom cache directory for downloaded grammars. When `None`, uses the default: `~/.cache/tree-sitter-language-pack/v{version}/libs/`. |
| `languages` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Languages to pre-download on init (e.g., `\["python", "rust"\]`). |
| `groups` | `list\[str\] \| None` | `None` | Language groups to pre-download (e.g., `\["web", "systems", "scripting"\]`). |
| `process` | `TreeSitterProcessConfig` | — | Processing options for code analysis. |

---

### TreeSitterProcessConfig

Processing options for tree-sitter code analysis.

Controls which analysis features are enabled when extracting code files.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |

When OCR is performed with element extraction enabled, this field contains the structured representation of detected text including: - Bounding geometry (rectangles or quadrilaterals) - Confidence scores (detection and recognition) - Rotation information - Hierarchical relationships (Tesseract only) This field preserves all metadata that would otherwise be lost when converting to plain text or markdown output formats. Only populated when `OcrElementConfig.include_elements` is true. |
| `document` | `DocumentStructure \| None` | `None` | Structured document tree (when document structure extraction is enabled). When `include_document_structure` is true in `ExtractionConfig`, this field contains the full hierarchical representation of the document including: - Heading-driven section nesting - Table grids with cell-level metadata - Content layer classification (body, header, footer, footnote) - Inline text annotations (formatting, links) - Bounding boxes and page numbers Independent of `result_format` — can be combined with Unified or ElementBased. |

When extracting archives, each processable file inside produces its own full extraction result. Set to `None` for non-archive formats. Use `max_archive_depth` in config to control recursion depth. |
| `uris` | `list\[ExtractedUri\] \| None` | `\[\]` | URIs/links discovered during document extraction. Contains hyperlinks, image references, citations, email addresses, and other URI-like references found in the document. Always extracted when present in the source document. |
| `revisions` | `list\[DocumentRevision\] \| None` | `\[\]` | Tracked changes embedded in the source document. Populated by per-format extractors that understand change-tracking metadata (DOCX `w:ins`/`w:del`/`w:rPrChange`, ODT `text:change-*`, …). Every extractor defaults to `None` until its format-specific implementation is added. Extractors that do populate this field follow the "accepted-changes" convention: inserted text is present in `content`, deleted text is absent — the revision list is the separate audit trail. |
| `structured_output` | `dict\[str, Any\] \| None` | `None` | Structured extraction output from LLM-based JSON schema extraction. When `structured_extraction` is configured in `ExtractionConfig`, the extracted document content is sent to a VLM with the provided JSON schema.

The redaction processor rewrites `content`, `formatted_content`, every chunk's text, and the textual fields of `entities` / `summary` / `translation` / `page_classifications` in place. This report describes what was found and how it was replaced. `None` when redaction is not configured. |
| `formulas` | `list\[Formula\]` | `\[\]` | Mathematical formulas recognized in the document. Populated by the layout-guided formula pipeline when the `layout-detection` feature is enabled and the document contains regions classified as formulas. Empty otherwise. |
| `form_fields` | `list\[PdfFormField\]` | `\[\]` | Form fields extracted from a PDF's AcroForm or XFA structure. Populated by the PDF extractor when `PdfConfig.extract_form_fields` is enabled (default) and the document is a fillable form. Empty otherwise. |
| `formatted_content` | `str \| None` | `None` | Pre-rendered content in the requested output format. Populated during `derive_extraction_result` before tree derivation consumes element data. `apply_output_format` swaps this into `content` at the end of the pipeline, after post-processors have operated on plain text. |

---

### LlmUsage

Token usage and cost data for a single LLM call made during extraction.

Populated when VLM OCR, structured extraction, or LLM-based embeddings
are used. Multiple entries may be present when multiple LLM calls occur

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_pdf_text_heuristics` | `bool` | `True` | Enable PDF text-layer detection heuristics. When `True`, PDFs with a substantial text layer will skip chunking. Default: `True`. |
| `text_layer_threshold` | `float` | `0.7` | Minimum fraction of pages that must have text to skip chunking. Range `0.0..=1.0`. Default: `0.7` (70 % of pages). |
| `file_size_threshold_bytes` | `int` | `10485760` | File size threshold in bytes for considering chunking. Files smaller than this are processed without chunking. Default: 10 MiB (10 × 1 024 × 1 024). |

### MultidocThresholds

Thresholds for multi-document boundary detection.

All fields are public; callers override any subset via struct-update syntax.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|

| `bigram_overlap_min` | `float` | `0.1` | Minimum bigram-overlap ratio below which a density shift is promoted to a `DensityShift` boundary.  Default: 0.1 (10 % overlap). |

---

### StructuredThresholds

Thresholds for the structured-extraction call-mode heuristic.

All defaults are **conservative starting points**.  Deployments should
measure their own document corpus and override via their own config;
these values are chosen to be safe-by-default, not to be optimal for
any particular workload.

Construct custom thresholds with struct-update syntax:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `scan_max_coverage` | `float` | `0.1` | PDFs with `text_coverage` strictly below this are treated as scanned. **Conservative default: 0.10** — deployments override via their own config after measuring their document corpus. |
| `digital_min_coverage` | `float` | `0.9` | PDFs with `text_coverage` at or above this AND zero embedded images route to `StructuredCallMode.TextOnly`. **Conservative default: 0.90** — deployments override via their own config after measuring their document corpus. |
| `docx_text_min_density` | `float` | `200` | DOCX / HTML / text documents with `avg_chars_per_page` above this route to `StructuredCallMode.TextOnly`. **Conservative default: 200.0** — deployments override via their own config after measuring their document corpus. |
| `enable_vision_fallback` | `bool` | `False` | When `True`, emit `StructuredCallMode.TextOnlyWithVisionFallback` instead of `StructuredCallMode.TextOnly` so the orchestrator can escalate to vision on low confidence. **Conservative default: `False`** — must be explicitly enabled per deployment after bench validation; deployments override via their own config. |

---

### PaddleOcrConfig

Configuration for PaddleOCR backend.

Configures PaddleOCR text detection and recognition with multi-language support.
Uses a builder pattern for convenient configuration.

| `det_limit_side_len` | `int` | — | Maximum side length for detection image (default: 960) Larger images may be resized to this limit for faster inference |
| `rec_batch_num` | `int` | — | Batch size for recognition inference (default: 6) Number of text regions to process simultaneously |
| `padding` | `int` | — | Padding in pixels added around the image before detection (default: 10). Large values can include surrounding content like table gridlines. |
| `drop_score` | `float` | — | Minimum recognition confidence score for text lines (default: 0.5). Text regions with recognition confidence below this threshold are discarded. Matches PaddleOCR Python's `drop_score` parameter. Range: 0.0-1.0 |
| `model_tier` | `str` | — | Model tier controlling detection/recognition model size and accuracy trade-off. - `"mobile"` (default): Lightweight models (~4.5MB detection, ~16.5MB recognition), fast download and inference - `"server"`: Large, high-accuracy models (~88MB detection, ~84MB recognition), best for GPU or complex documents |

---

### PdfMetadata

PDF-specific metadata.

Contains metadata fields specific to PDF documents that are not in the common
`Metadata` structure. Common fields like title, authors, keywords, and dates
are at the `Metadata` level.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |

|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `config` | `PageClassificationConfig` | — | Label set and LLM settings for the classification stage. |

---

### CaptioningEnrichmentConfig

Captioning enrichment knob: which LLM to use for image captions.

The enrichment stage calls `caption_image` for every
image in `ExtractionResult.images` that has non-empty `data`. Images with
empty byte data (e.g. reference-only images populated via `source_path`) are
skipped rather than forwarded to the VLM.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `config` | `LlmConfig` | — | LLM / VLM configuration forwarded verbatim to each `caption_image` call. |
| `custom_prompt` | `str \| None` | `None` | Optional custom prompt override forwarded to every `caption_image` call. `None` uses the default `RegionKind.Caption` prompt. |

---

### Enums

#### ChunkSizing

How chunk size is measured.

Defaults to `Characters` (Unicode character count). When using token-based sizing,
chunks are sized by token count according to the specified tokenizer.

Token-based sizing uses HuggingFace tokenizers loaded at runtime. Any tokenizer
available on HuggingFace Hub can be used, including OpenAI-compatible tokenizers
(e.g., `Xenova/gpt-4o`, `Xenova/cl100k_base`).

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Characters` | `characters` | Size measured in Unicode characters (default). |
| `Tokenizer` | `tokenizer` | Size measured in tokens from a HuggingFace tokenizer. — Fields: `model`: `String`, `cache_dir`: `PathBuf` |

---

#### ChunkerType

Type of text chunker to use.

### Variants

- `Text` - Generic text splitter, splits on whitespace and punctuation
- `Markdown` - Markdown-aware splitter, preserves formatting and structure
- `Yaml` - YAML-aware splitter, creates one chunk per top-level key
- `Semantic` - Topic-aware chunker. With an `EmbeddingConfig`, splits at
  embedding-based topic shifts tuned by `topic_threshold` (default 0.75,
  lower = more splits). Without an embedding, falls back to a
  structural-boundary heuristic (ALL-CAPS headers, numbered sections,
  blank-line paragraphs) and merges groups into chunks capped at
  `max_characters` (default 1000). `topic_threshold` has no effect in the
  fallback path. For best results, pair with an embedding model.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Text` | `text` | Generic whitespace- and punctuation-aware text splitter (default). |
| `Markdown` | `markdown` | Markdown-aware splitter that preserves heading and code-block boundaries. |
| `Yaml` | `yaml` | YAML-aware splitter that creates one chunk per top-level key. |
| `Semantic` | `semantic` | Topic-aware chunker that splits at embedding-based topic shifts. |

---

#### ChunkingReason

Reason for chunking a document.

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `LargeFile` | File exceeds size threshold. — Fields: `size_bytes`: `u64`, `threshold_bytes`: `u64` |
| `ManyPages` | Document has many pages. — Fields: `page_count`: `u32`, `threshold`: `u32` |
| `OcrRequired` | PDF requires OCR and is large. — Fields: `page_count`: `u32`, `force_ocr`: `bool` |
| `LargeAndManyPages` | Both size and page count exceed thresholds. — Fields: `size_bytes`: `u64`, `page_count`: `u32` |

---

#### CodeContentMode

Content rendering mode for code extraction.

Controls how extracted code content is represented in the `content` field
of `ExtractionResult`.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Chunks` | `chunks` | Use TSLP semantic chunks as content (default). |
| `Raw` | `raw` | Use raw source code as content. |
| `Structure` | `structure` | Emit function/class headings + docstrings (no code bodies). |

---

#### DiffLine

A single line in a unified-diff hunk.

Defined here (rather than only in `crate.diff`) so `RevisionDelta` can
reference it unconditionally, without requiring the `diff` Cargo feature.
`crate.diff` re-exports this type verbatim.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Context` | `context` | Unchanged context line. — Fields: `_0`: `String` |
| `Added` | `added` | Line added in the "after" version. — Fields: `_0`: `String` |
| `Removed` | `removed` | Line removed from the "before" version. — Fields: `_0`: `String` |

---

#### EmbeddingModelType

Embedding model types supported by Xberg.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Preset` | `preset` | Use a preset model configuration (recommended) — Fields: `name`: `String` |
| `Custom` | `custom` | Use a custom ONNX model from HuggingFace — Fields: `model_id`: `String`, `dimensions`: `usize` |
| `Llm` | `llm` | Provider-hosted embedding model via liter-llm. Uses the model specified in the nested `LlmConfig` (e.g., `"openai/text-embedding-3-small"`). — Fields: `llm`: `LlmConfig` |
| `Plugin` | `plugin` | In-process embedding backend registered via the plugin system. The caller registers an `EmbeddingBackend` once (e.g. a wrapper around an already-loaded `llama-cpp-python`, `sentence-transformers`, or tuned ONNX model), then references it by name in config. Xberg calls back into the registered backend during chunking and standalone embed requests — no HuggingFace download, no ONNX Runtime requirement, no HTTP sidecar. When this variant is selected, only the following `EmbeddingConfig` fields apply: `normalize` (post-call L2 normalization) and `max_embed_duration_secs` (dispatcher timeout). Model-loading fields (`batch_size`, `cache_dir`, `show_download_progress`, `acceleration`) are ignored — the host owns the model lifecycle. Semantic chunking falls back to `ChunkingConfig.max_characters` when this variant is used, since there is no preset to look a chunk-size ceiling up against — size your context window via `max_characters` directly. See `register_embedding_backend`. — Fields: `name`: `String` |

---

#### EntityCategory

Standard entity categories produced by built-in NER backends.

The `Custom(String)` variant lets caller-supplied categories (e.g. LLM

#### ImageOutputFormat

Target format for re-encoding extracted images.

Controls whether and how extracted images are normalised to a uniform
container format before being returned in `ExtractionResult.images`.
The default (`Native`) preserves the format produced by each extractor
without any additional encode pass.

Callers that need uniform output — e.g. cloud pipelines that always store
WebP thumbnails — set this once on `ImageExtractionConfig.output_format`
rather than re-encoding downstream.

### Serde shape

Uses a tagged enum: `{"type": "native"}`, `{"type": "png"}`,
`{"type": "jpeg", "quality": 90}`, etc.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Native` | `native` | Preserve whatever format the extractor produced (default). No re-encode pass is performed. `ExtractedImage.format` reflects the source format: JPEG for embedded PDF images, PNG for rasterised content, or the native container format from office documents. |
| `Png` | `png` | Re-encode all extracted images as PNG (lossless). |
| `Jpeg` | `jpeg` | Re-encode all extracted images as JPEG at the given quality level. `quality` must be in `1..=100`. Values outside this range are clamped and a warning is emitted. Higher values produce larger files with less artefacting; 85 is a reasonable default. — Fields: `quality`: `u8` |
| `Webp` | `webp` | Re-encode all extracted images as WebP at the given quality level. `quality` must be in `1..=100`. Values outside this range are clamped and a warning is emitted. 80 is a reasonable default. — Fields: `quality`: `u8` |
| `Heif` | `heif` | Re-encode all extracted images as HEIF/HEIC at the given quality level. Requires the `heic` feature. `quality` must be in `1..=100`. Values outside this range are clamped and a warning is emitted. 80 is a reasonable default. — Fields: `quality`: `u8` |
| `Svg` | `svg` | Output pure-vector SVG. Lossless. Raster sources are not re-encoded (a warning is emitted and the image bytes are left untouched). When the source is already SVG, the bytes are passed through the `usvg` sanitizer (strips external hrefs, JS event handlers, and `foreignObject` elements) when `SvgOptions.sanitize` is `True`. Requires the `svg` feature. |

| `Location` | `location` | Location, surfaced by the optional NER backend. |
| `Custom` | `custom` | Caller-supplied custom category (e.g. internal employee IDs). Surfaced by the redaction engine when a hit comes from `RedactionConfig.custom_terms` or `RedactionConfig.custom_patterns`. The string is the label passed alongside the term/pattern. Use those fields rather than constructing `Custom` directly via the `categories` filter — the pattern engine cannot detect arbitrary text from a category name alone. — Fields: `_0`: `String` |

---

#### RedactionStrategy

Strategy applied when a PII match is rewritten.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Mask` | `mask` | Replace the matched span with a fixed mask token (default `"\[REDACTED\]"`). |
| `Hash` | `hash` | Replace with a SHA-256 hash of the original value (truncated to 16 hex chars). Lets downstream consumers do equality joins without recovering the source. |
| `TokenReplace` | `token_replace` | Replace with a per-category running token (`"\[PERSON_1\]"`, `"\[PERSON_2\]"`, …) so the same person referenced twice gets the same token within the document. |
| `Drop` | `drop` | Delete the matched span entirely. |

---

#### ReductionLevel

Intensity level for the token-reduction pipeline.

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Off` | No reduction applied; text is returned as-is. |
| `Light` | Remove only the most common stopwords. |
| `Moderate` | Balanced stopword removal and redundancy filtering. |
| `Aggressive` | Aggressive filtering; may remove less common content words. |
| `Maximum` | Maximum compression; prioritizes brevity over completeness. |

---

#### RerankerModelType

Reranker model types supported by Xberg.

Since v5.0.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Preset` | `preset` | Use a preset cross-encoder model (recommended). — Fields: `name`: `String` |
| `Custom` | `custom` | Use a custom ONNX cross-encoder from HuggingFace. — Fields: `model_id`: `String`, `model_file`: `String`, `additional_files`: `Vec<String>`, `max_length`: `i64` |
| `Llm` | `llm` | Provider-hosted reranker via liter-llm (e.g. Cohere, Jina, Voyage). The model in the nested `LlmConfig` must be a rerank-capable model ID (e.g. `"cohere/rerank-english-v3.0"`). — Fields: `llm`: `LlmConfig` |
| `Plugin` | `plugin` | In-process reranker registered via the plugin system. The caller registers a `RerankerBackend` once (e.g. a wrapper around a `sentence-transformers` cross-encoder or a provider client), then references it by name in config. Xberg calls back into the registered backend — no HuggingFace download, no ONNX Runtime requirement. When this variant is selected, only `max_rerank_duration_secs` applies. Model-loading fields (`batch_size`, `cache_dir`, `show_download_progress`, `acceleration`) are ignored — the host owns the model lifecycle. See `register_reranker_backend`. — Fields: `name`: `String` |

---

#### ResultFormat

Result-shape selection for extraction results.

Distinct from `OutputFormat` (which controls rendering — Plain, Markdown,
HTML, etc.). `ResultFormat` controls the *shape* of the result: a unified content
blob vs. an element-based decomposition.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Unified` | `unified` | Unified format with all content in `content` field |
| `ElementBased` | `element_based` | Element-based format with semantic element extraction |

---

#### SummaryStrategy

Summarisation strategy.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Extractive` | `extractive` | Pure-Rust extractive summary (TextRank over the chunk graph). Deterministic, fast, no external service required. |
| `Abstractive` | `abstractive` | Abstractive summary produced by liter-llm. Requires `liter-llm` feature and a configured `LlmConfig`. Token usage is captured in `ExtractionResult.llm_usage`. |

---

#### TableChunkingMode

Controls how markdown tables are handled when they exceed the chunk size limit.

Only applies when `chunker_type` is `Markdown`.

### Variants

- `Split` - Default behavior: tables are split at row boundaries like any
  other block element. Continuation chunks contain only data rows without
  the header, which can break downstream consumers that need column context.

- `RepeatHeader` - Prepend the table header (header row + separator row) to
  every continuation chunk that contains data rows from the same table.
  Adds a small amount of duplicate text but ensures each chunk is
  self-contained for extraction, search, and LLM consumption.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Split` | `split` | Split tables at row boundaries (default). Continuation chunks have no header. |
| `RepeatHeader` | `repeat_header` | Prepend the table header to every chunk that continues a split table. |

---

#### TableModel

Which table structure recognition model to use.

Controls the model used for table cell detection within layout-detected
table regions. Wire format is snake_case in all serializers (JSON, TOML,
YAML).

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Tatr` | `tatr` | TATR (Table Transformer) -- default, 30MB, DETR-based row/column detection. |
| `SlanetWired` | `slanet_wired` | SLANeXT wired variant -- 365MB, optimized for bordered tables. |
| `SlanetWireless` | `slanet_wireless` | SLANeXT wireless variant -- 365MB, optimized for borderless tables. |
| `SlanetPlus` | `slanet_plus` | SLANet-plus -- 7.78MB, lightweight general-purpose. |
| `SlanetAuto` | `slanet_auto` | Classifier-routed SLANeXT: auto-select wired/wireless per table. Uses PP-LCNet classifier (6.78MB) + both SLANeXT variants (730MB total). |
| `Disabled` | `disabled` | Disable table structure model inference entirely; use heuristic path only. |

---

#### TextDirection

Text direction enumeration for HTML documents.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `LeftToRight` | `ltr` | Left-to-right text direction |
| `RightToLeft` | `rtl` | Right-to-left text direction |
| `Auto` | `auto` | Automatic text direction detection |

---

#### UrlExtractionMode

URL extraction mode.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Auto` | `auto` | Classify HTTP(S) resources after fetch. |
| `Document` | `document` | Treat the URI as a single remote document/page. |
| `Crawl` | `crawl` | Crawl from the seed URI and extract discovered pages/documents. |

---

#### VlmFallbackPolicy

Policy controlling when VLM (Vision Language Model) OCR is used as a fallback.

This knob is syntactic sugar over the explicit `OcrPipelineConfig` stage
ordering. When `vlm_fallback` is set and `pipeline` is `None`, an equivalent
pipeline is synthesised at extraction time:

- `VlmFallbackPolicy.Disabled` — no synthesis; single-backend mode (default).
- `VlmFallbackPolicy.OnLowQuality` — tries the classical backend first; if the
  result scores below `quality_threshold`, tries VLM.

- `VlmFallbackPolicy.Always` — skips the classical backend and sends every page
  to the VLM.

When `OcrConfig.pipeline` is explicitly set, `vlm_fallback` is ignored — the
explicit pipeline takes precedence.

**Errors:**

Both `OnLowQuality` and `Always` require `OcrConfig.vlm_config` to be `Some`.
Constructing an `OcrConfig` with one of these policies but no `vlm_config` is
detected by `OcrConfig.validate` and will surface as a
`Validation` error at extraction time, not a panic.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Disabled` | `disabled` | No VLM fallback (default). Behaves identically to the pre-policy single-backend mode. |
| `OnLowQuality` | `on_low_quality` | Try the classical OCR backend first. If the quality score is below `quality_threshold`, send the page to the VLM. `quality_threshold` is in the `\[0.0, 1.0\]` range produced by `calculate_quality_score`. A value of `0.5` is a reasonable starting point; calibrate with the Stage 0 benchmark harness. — Fields: `quality_threshold`: `f64` |
| `Always` | `always` | Skip the classical OCR backend entirely. Every page is sent to the VLM. |

---

#### WhisperModel

Supported Whisper model sizes.

These map to published ONNX exports on Hugging Face (onnx-community or
similar orgs). The actual filenames and repos are resolved inside the
transcription engine.

| Variant | Wire value | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Tiny` | `tiny` | Smallest, fastest, lowest quality. Good default for development and CI. |
| `Base` | `base` | Reasonable quality/speed tradeoff. |
| `Small` | `small` | Better accuracy with higher memory and cache use. |
| `Medium` | `medium` | High quality; slower and more memory-intensive. |
| `LargeV3` | `large_v3` | Best quality (large-v3). Use only when latency and memory use are acceptable. |

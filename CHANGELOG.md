## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Bring your own tokenizer for token-budgeted chunking.** Register a `TokenizerBackend`
  plugin (`register_tokenizer_backend`) — from Rust or any language binding — and reference
  it by name from `ChunkSizing::Tokenizer { model }`. The registry is checked before the
  HuggingFace path, so chunks are sized with the exact tokenizer the consumer's embedder
  uses (llama.cpp/GGUF vocabularies, SentencePiece models, custom vocabs). Existing
  HuggingFace-id configs behave unchanged.

### Changed

- **`OcrExtractionResult` now derives `Default`.** Downstream bindings and callers can
  construct and extend it without spelling out every field.

### Fixed

- **PDF/OCR worker-stack overflow.** The deep per-page OCR extraction futures are now
  boxed (`Box::pin`) so their large state lives on the heap instead of inflating the
  worker-thread stack frame. Together with the stack the binding runtimes provision for
  the async path, this stops scanned / image-only PDFs from aborting the process with a
  stack overflow (SIGBUS) during OCR.
- **Tesseract image OCR no longer fails on an empty language list.** `OcrConfig { language: [] }`
  joined to an empty Tesseract language string, which the native backend tried to load as a
  language pack named `""` — surfacing as the confusing `Failed to download language pack ''`.
  An empty language now defaults to English consistently across every OCR backend, matching the
  documented `OcrConfig` default. PaddleOCR results also report English in their metadata instead
  of an empty language when none is configured.
- **WASM Tesseract backend builds again.** It still treated the OCR `language` config as a single
  string after it became a list, so the WebAssembly build stopped compiling. It now uses the
  primary language (the in-memory WASI Tesseract handles one language at a time, like the PaddleOCR
  and VLM backends) and warns when more than one is requested.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-06-26

Initial Xberg release candidate. Xberg continues the Kreuzberg document-intelligence
engine under a new name with a reset v1 version line. This is a full rebrand with no
back-compat aliases; the published `kreuzberg` packages remain frozen on the v4 LTS line.

### Changed

- **Rebranded Kreuzberg → Xberg.**
  - **Rust:** crate `kreuzberg` → `xberg` (and every `kreuzberg-*` workspace crate →
    `xberg-*`); the `kreuzberg::` namespace → `xberg::`; `KreuzbergError` → `XbergError`.
  - **CLI:** binary `kreuzberg` → `xberg`; config discovery `kreuzberg.{toml,yaml,json}` →
    `xberg.{toml,yaml,json}`; all `KREUZBERG_*` environment variables → `XBERG_*`; cache
    directory `.kreuzberg/` → `.xberg/`.
  - **FFI:** symbol prefix `kreuzberg_*` → `xberg_*`; header `kreuzberg.h` → `xberg.h`; lib
    `kreuzberg_ffi` → `xberg_ffi`.
  - **Package coordinates:** PyPI `xberg`, npm `@xberg-io/*`, RubyGems/Hex/pub.dev `xberg`,
    Maven `io.xberg`, NuGet `Xberg`, Packagist `xberg-io/xberg`, Homebrew `xberg`.
  - **Go:** module `github.com/xberg-io/xberg` with no `/vN` suffix (v1); the binding lives at
    `packages/go/`.
  - **Docs:** documentation now at `docs.xberg.io`.
- **ner-onnx:** vendored the stripped span-mode GLiNER runtime as `xberg-gliner`, replaced the
  ORP pipeline wrapper with direct `ort` session management, and moved runtime model downloads
  to the `xberg-io/gliner-models` artifact repository. The public `ner-onnx` feature and NER
  config shape are unchanged.

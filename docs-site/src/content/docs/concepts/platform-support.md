This page mirrors [`PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md`](https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/blob/main/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md)
at the repository root. That file is the canonical source — it is derived from the build matrices in
`.github/workflows/publish.yaml`. Update the root file first, then re-sync this page.

## Known gaps and rationale

1. **Node - macOS x64 (Intel) - dropped (rc.23).** pyke ships no static x64-mac ORT, and
   Microsoft's last x86_64-macOS ONNX Runtime dylib is 1.23.2 (the CLI vendors that one), so at the
   time CI provisioned ORT via Homebrew, whose bottle dynamically links a ~252-lib abseil closure
   at absolute Homebrew paths. The self-containment vendor step
   (`scripts/ci/vendor-macos-node-dylibs.sh`) correctly rejected the non-portable package, and the
   Intel-mac node leg was dropped. Intel Mac users run the arm64 binding under Rosetta or use the
   WASM package. In rc.22 this leg failed (so no node package published at all); the drop lands in
   rc.23.
2. **PHP** builds against 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 on every listed platform.
3. **Dart** ships the server-mode native; the full pub.dev package has a known size blocker (all-platform
   natives exceed the 100 MB cap) tracked separately in the release notes.
4. **Zig** consumes the C FFI GitHub-release artifacts, so its platform coverage equals C FFI's.
5. **Swift** targets Apple platforms only: macOS (Apple Silicon) and iOS (arm64). Intel-mac and
   iOS-simulator-x86_64 are excluded; no Linux or Windows SwiftPM artifact ships.
6. **Kotlin/Android** ships the two Android ABIs: `arm64-v8a` (devices) and `x86_64` (emulator). Both
   ABIs build with the same ORT-free `android-target` feature set (no PaddleOCR-via-ORT or ONNX
   Runtime embeddings on either ABI); there is no separate ORT-enabled build for arm64 devices.
   RT-DETR layout detection, the wired/wireless table classifier, PaddleOCR, and document-orientation
   detection run on both ABIs through the pure-Rust `tract` engine (see note 8) instead of ORT.
7. **WASM** is a single `wasm32` artifact, portable across any WASM runtime (browser and Node). It uses
   the `wasm-target` feature set (`ocr-wasm`, `excel-wasm`, `layout-tract`, `auto-rotate-tract`,
   `ner-candle-wasm`; no native ORT). Tree-sitter code intelligence is **excluded**: the 371-language
   grammar pack pushes the `.wasm` past the 50 MB per-file limit of public CDNs (jsDelivr), so source
   files extract as text but are not parsed. Layout detection and document-orientation run through the
   pure-Rust `tract` engine (see note 8). Named-entity recognition runs in the browser through the
   pure-Rust candle GLiNER2 backend (see note 9).
8. **Pure-Rust `tract` engine.** Where a target cannot link native ONNX Runtime, xberg's inference seam
   can compile select ONNX models against the pure-Rust `tract` engine (`tract-onnx`, no native library,
   CPU-only) instead. Document-orientation detection (`auto-rotate-tract`) and RT-DETR layout detection
   (plus the wired/wireless table classifier, with the `pdf` feature) run this way, matching ONNX Runtime
   within 5e-3 on their outputs. Both are enabled for `android-target` (so the x86_64 Android emulator
   detects page orientation and layout for the first time) and for `wasm-target`: the WASM build exposes
   `detectLayout` / `detectOrientation`, which take the `.onnx` weights as streamed bytes (the JS host
   fetches them and hands them to the seam). PaddleOCR, TATR, SLANeXT, and PP-DocLayout-V3 remain ONNX
   Runtime-only.
9. **In-browser entity detection.** The WASM build exposes `NerModel`, which runs GLiNER2 named-entity
   recognition entirely inside the page — no server round-trip and no ONNX Runtime, through the
   pure-Rust candle backend (`ner-candle-wasm`, the no-tokio sibling of the native `ner-candle`).
   Weights are not embedded in the `.wasm`; the host fetches the safetensors, tokenizer, and encoder
   config and passes the bytes to `NerModel.load`. Unlike the byte-oriented `detectLayout` /
   `detectOrientation` functions, the model stays resident across calls, so the weights are parsed
   once. Inference is synchronous CPU work on a single-threaded target — run it in a Web Worker if
   main-thread responsiveness matters.
10. **Go musl** archives ship the dynamic `xberg-ffi` library and its vendored native-library closure.
    The generated setup command detects Alpine/musl automatically. Its `-link static` mode is available
    on glibc Linux, macOS, and Windows x64, but not on musl.

## Cross-cutting gaps

- **musl (Alpine):** shipped by CLI, Java, C#, Elixir, Node, and Go. Go's musl archive is
  dynamic-only (see note 10). Python, Ruby, PHP, Dart, C FFI, and Zig ship glibc-only Linux.
- **Windows:** every desktop binding ships Windows x64 except Ruby (no RubyGems Windows native) and the
  Apple/mobile/wasm bindings (not applicable).
- **Intel Mac (macOS x64):** shipped by most bindings; not by Node (see gap 1) or Swift.
- **Linux arm64 musl** exists only where full musl is listed (CLI, Java, C#, Elixir, Node, Go).

This page mirrors [`PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md`](https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg/blob/main/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md)
at the repository root. That file is the canonical source — it is derived from the build matrices in
`.github/workflows/publish.yaml`. Update the root file first, then re-sync this page.

## Known gaps and rationale

1. **Node - macOS x64 (Intel) - dropped (rc.23).** pyke ships no static x64-mac ORT, and
   Microsoft's last x86_64-macOS ONNX Runtime dylib is 1.23.2 (the CLI vendors that one), so at the
   time CI provisioned ORT via Homebrew, whose bottle dynamically links a ~252-lib abseil closure
   at absolute Homebrew paths. The self-containment vendor step
   (`scripts/ci/vendor-macos-node-dylibs.sh`) correctly rejected the non-portable package, and the
   Intel-mac node leg was dropped. Intel Mac users run the arm64 binding under Rosetta or use the
   WASM package. In rc.22 this leg failed (so no node package published at all); the drop lands in
   rc.23.
2. **PHP** builds against 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 on every listed platform.
3. **Dart** ships the server-mode native; the full pub.dev package has a known size blocker (all-platform
   natives exceed the 100 MB cap) tracked separately in the release notes.
4. **Zig** consumes the C FFI GitHub-release artifacts, so its platform coverage equals C FFI's.
5. **Swift** targets Apple platforms only: macOS (Apple Silicon) and iOS (arm64). Intel-mac and
   iOS-simulator-x86_64 are excluded; there is no Linux or Windows SwiftPM artifact.
6. **Kotlin/Android** ships the two Android ABIs: `arm64-v8a` (devices) and `x86_64` (emulator). The
   x86_64-emulator native uses the ORT-free `android-target` feature set (no PaddleOCR, layout
   detection, embeddings, or auto-rotate); arm64 devices get the full ORT-enabled build.
7. **WASM** is a single `wasm32` artifact, portable across any WASM runtime (browser and Node). It uses
   the `wasm-target` feature set (`ocr-wasm`, `excel-wasm`, `tree-sitter-wasm`; no native ORT).

## Cross-cutting gaps

- **musl (Alpine / static Linux):** shipped only by CLI, Java, C#, Elixir, and Node. Python, Ruby, Go,
  PHP, Dart, C FFI, and Zig ship glibc-only Linux; musl consumers must build from source.
- **Windows:** every desktop binding ships Windows x64 except Ruby (no RubyGems Windows native) and the
  Apple/mobile/wasm bindings (not applicable).
- **Intel Mac (macOS x64):** shipped by most bindings; not by Node (see gap 1) or Swift.
- **Linux arm64 musl** exists only where full musl is listed (CLI, Java, C#, Elixir, Node).

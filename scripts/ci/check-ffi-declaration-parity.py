"""Guard hand-declared FFI surfaces against the C header the FFI backend actually emitted.

Two of our bindings restate every native signature by hand and nothing checks the restatement:
C# `DllImport` in `NativeMethods.cs` and Java Panama `FunctionDescriptor` in `NativeLib.java`.
Both compile clean when wrong, and misbehave only when the call runs. Go escapes the whole
family because cgo type-checks against the real header at build time -- which is also why this
went unnoticed for so long.

GH#1595. `xberg_registry_sample_bytes` takes six parameters and returns `int32_t`. C# declared
three parameters and a pointer-width `IntPtr` return; the call site null-checked that "pointer",
so a success status of 1 passed the guard and `Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8` dereferenced address 1
before `FreeString` freed it. **Java declared the same function identically wrong.** The first
diagnosis -- "a bad template in the C# emitter" -- was wrong: it is every unverified backend.

## The property

For every native symbol a binding declares, the declaration must match the header in ARITY, in
per-parameter width class, and in return width class. This is deliberately compared against the
emitted header rather than a type set the check builds for itself: a fixture can only catch
disagreements about a rule both sides already share, and so is structurally blind to arity, to
return pointer-ness, and to a function rendered by the wrong template -- which is every part of
GH#1595.

## Width classes, not exact spellings

`uintptr_t` and `UIntPtr` are both pointer-width and agree; comparing spellings would
report them and train readers to ignore output. Panama layout constants classify through
the same path, so one comparison serves both surfaces.

A type this script CANNOT read fails the check rather than being skipped. "I could not
read this" and "these agree" must never produce the same result. The original version
skipped, and that single choice hid two real defects at once: `XBERGAlefHandle` was
unreadable, so almost no parameter was compared while the run reported a clean pass over
282 declarations; and `void` was unreadable, so five `int32_t` returns declared `void` in
C# (GH#1596) compared as agreeing. Skipping is how a check becomes decorative.

Pointer-width is treated as interchangeable with a fixed 64 bits, which is what makes a
`uintptr_t` return declared as C# `ulong` (seven of them today) legitimate rather than a
finding. That equivalence is TRUE ONLY BECAUSE every shipped runtime identifier is 64-bit,
so it is derived from `runtime.json.template` at run time instead of being assumed. Ship a
32-bit RID and the equivalence is withdrawn automatically and those declarations start
failing -- which is correct, because on that target `ulong` really would be the wrong
width. The alternative, a static waiver list, would have gone quietly stale at exactly the
moment it mattered.

## What is deliberately NOT guarded

Parameter NAMES and exact signedness. The emitters legitimately differ on both -- `this_`
vs `handle`, `int32_t` vs `int` for a bool-ish status -- and encoding that would make this
a change-detector rather than an invariant.

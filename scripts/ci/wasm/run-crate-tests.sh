# The suites live in the crate's hand-written modules (src/engine.rs) because
# the generated manifest builds only a cdylib, which integration tests under
# tests/ cannot link against. They run under Node because wasm-bindgen's test
# glue carries the same unresolvable "env" / "wasi_snapshot_preview1" imports
# (from the WASI-cross-compiled Tesseract in ocr-wasm) that
# crates/xberg-wasm/scripts/fix-wasi-imports.mjs patches out of the published
# package. The test runner generates its glue on the fly with no patch hook,
# so NODE_PATH supplies stub modules for those imports instead; see
# crates/xberg-wasm/test-shims/. ~keep
